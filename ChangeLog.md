  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/4060).

- Fixed performance regressions when using `std::back_insert_iterator` with
  `fmt::format_to` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/4070).

- Fixed handling of `std::generator` and move-only iterators
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/4053,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4057). Thanks @Arghnews.

- Made `formatter<std::string_view>::parse` work with types convertible to
  `std::string_view` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/4036,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4055). Thanks @Arghnews.

- Made `volatile void*` formattable
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/4049,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4056). Thanks @Arghnews.

- Made `Glib::ustring` not be confused with `std::string`
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/4052).

- Made `fmt::context` iterator compatible with STL algorithms that rely on
  iterator category (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/4079).

# 11.0.1 - 2024-07-05

  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/4047).

- Fixed disabling Unicode support via CMake
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/4051).

- Fixed deprecated `visit_format_arg` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4043).
  Thanks @nebkat.

- Fixed handling of a sign and improved the `std::complex` formater
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4034,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4050). Thanks @tesch1 and @phprus.

- Fixed ADL issues in `fmt::printf` when using C++20
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4042). Thanks @toge.

- Removed a redundant check in the formatter for `std::expected`
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4040). Thanks @phprus.

# 11.0.0 - 2024-07-01

- Added `fmt/base.h` which provides a subset of the API with minimal include
  dependencies and enough functionality to replace all uses of the `printf`
  family of functions. This brings the compile time of code using {fmt} much
  closer to the equivalent `printf` code as shown on the following benchmark
  that compiles 100 source files:

  | Method       | Compile Time (s) |
  |--------------|------------------|
  | printf       | 1.6              |
  | IOStreams    | 25.9             |
  | fmt 10.x     | 19.0             |
  | fmt 11.0     | 4.8              |
  | tinyformat   | 29.1             |
  | Boost Format | 55.0             |

  This gives almost 4x improvement in build speed compared to version 10.
  Note that the benchmark is purely formatting code and includes. In real
  projects the difference from `printf` will be smaller partly because common
  standard headers will be included in almost any translation unit (TU) anyway.
  In particular, in every case except `printf` above ~1s is spent in total on
  including `<type_traits>` in all TUs.

- Optimized includes in other headers such as `fmt/format.h` which is now
  roughly equivalent to the old `fmt/core.h` in terms of build speed.

- Migrated the documentation at https://fmt.dev/ from Sphinx to MkDocs.

- Improved C++20 module support
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3990,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3991,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3993,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3994,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3997,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3998,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4004,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4005,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4006,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4013,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4027,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4029). In particular, native CMake support
  for modules is now used if available. Thanks @yujincheng08 and @matt77hias.

- Added an option to replace standard includes with `import std` enabled via
  the `FMT_IMPORT_STD` macro (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3921,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3928). Thanks @matt77hias.

- Exported `fmt::range_format`, `fmt::range_format_kind` and
  `fmt::compiled_string` from the `fmt` module
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3970,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3999).
  Thanks @matt77hias and @yujincheng08.

- Improved integration with stdio in `fmt::print`, enabling direct writes
  into a C stream buffer in common cases. This may give significant
  performance improvements ranging from tens of percent to [2x](
  https://stackoverflow.com/a/78457454/471164) and eliminates dynamic memory
  allocations on the buffer level. It is currently enabled for built-in and
  string types with wider availability coming up in future releases.

  For example, it gives ~24% improvement on a [simple benchmark](
  https://isocpp.org/files/papers/P3107R5.html#perf) compiled with Apple clang
  version 15.0.0 (clang-1500.1.0.2.5) and run on macOS 14.2.1:

  ```
  -------------------------------------------------------
  Benchmark             Time             CPU   Iterations
  -------------------------------------------------------
  printf             81.8 ns         81.5 ns      8496899
  fmt::print (10.x)  63.8 ns         61.9 ns     11524151
  fmt::print (11.0)  51.3 ns         51.0 ns     13846580
  ```

- Improved safety of `fmt::format_to` when writing to an array
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3805).
  For example ([godbolt](https://www.godbolt.org/z/cYrn8dWY8)):

  ```c++
  auto volkswagen = char[4];
  auto result = fmt::format_to(volkswagen, "elephant");
  ```

  no longer results in a buffer overflow. Instead the output will be truncated
  and you can get the end iterator and whether truncation occurred from the
  `result` object. Thanks @ThePhD.

- Enabled Unicode support by default in MSVC, bringing it on par with other
  compilers and making it unnecessary for users to enable it explicitly.
  Most of {fmt} is encoding-agnostic but this prevents mojibake in places
  where encoding matters such as path formatting and terminal output.
  You can control the Unicode support via the CMake `FMT_UNICODE` option.
  Note that some {fmt} packages such as the one in vcpkg have already been
  compiled with Unicode enabled.

- Added a formatter for `std::expected`
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3834). Thanks @dominicpoeschko.

- Added a formatter for `std::complex`
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1467,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3886,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3892,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3900). Thanks @phprus.

- Added a formatter for `std::type_info`
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3978). Thanks @matt77hias.

- Specialized `formatter` for `std::basic_string` types with custom traits
  and allocators (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3938,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3943). Thanks @dieram3.

- Added formatters for `std::chrono::day`, `std::chrono::month`,
  `std::chrono::year` and `std::chrono::year_month_day`
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3758,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3772,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3906,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3913). For example:

  ```c++
  #include <fmt/chrono.h>
  #include <fmt/color.h>

  int main() {
    fmt::print(fg(fmt::color::green), "{}\n", std::chrono::day(7));
  }
  ```

  prints a green day:

  <img width="306" alt="image" src="https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/assets/576385/6e395f8b-451a-4cf7-bccc-ee92ca0dec65">

  Thanks @zivshek.

- Fixed the scope of the `-` extension in chrono formatting so that it doesn't
  apply to subsequent specifiers (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3811,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3812). Thanks @phprus.

- Added `fmt::basic_format_arg::visit` and deprecated `fmt::visit_format_arg`.

- Made `fmt::basic_string_view` not constructible from `nullptr` for
  consistency with `std::string_view` in C++23

# 10.2.1 - 2024-01-04

- Fixed ABI compatibility with earlier 10.x versions
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3785,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3786). Thanks @saraedum.

# 10.2.0 - 2024-01-01

- Added support for the `%j` specifier (the number of days) for
  `std::chrono::duration` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3643,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3732). Thanks @intelfx.

- Added support for the chrono suffix for days and changed
  the suffix for minutes from "m" to the correct "min"
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3662,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3664).
  For example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/9KhMnq9ba)):

  ```c++
  #include <fmt/chrono.h>

  int main() {
    fmt::print("{}\n", std::chrono::days(42)); // prints "42d"
  }
  ```

  Thanks @Richardk2n.

- Fixed an overflow in `std::chrono::time_point` formatting with large dates
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3725,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3727). Thanks @cschreib.

- Added a formatter for `std::source_location`
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3730).
  For example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/YajfKjhhr)):

  ```c++
  #include <source_location>
  #include <fmt/std.h>

  int main() {
    fmt::print("{}\n", std::source_location::current());
  }
  ```

  prints

  ```
  /app/example.cpp:5:51: int main()
  ```

  Thanks @felix642.

- Added a formatter for `std::bitset`
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3660).
  For example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/bdEaGeYxe)):

  ```c++
  #include <bitset>
  #include <fmt/std.h>

  int main() {
    fmt::print("{}\n", std::bitset<6>(42)); // prints "101010"
  }
  ```

  Thanks @muggenhor.

- Added an experimental `nested_formatter` that provides an easy way of
  applying a formatter to one or more subobjects while automatically handling
  width, fill and alignment. For example:

  ```c++
  #include <fmt/format.h>

  struct point {
    double x, y;
  };

  template <>
  struct fmt::formatter<point> : nested_formatter<double> {
    auto format(point p, format_context& ctx) const {
      return write_padded(ctx, [=](auto out) {
        return format_to(out, "({}, {})", nested(p.x), nested(p.y));
      });
    }
  };

  int main() {
    fmt::print("[{:>20.2f}]", point{1, 2});
  }
  ```

  prints

  ```
  [          (1.00, 2.00)]
  ```

- Added the generic representation (`g`) to `std::filesystem::path`
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3715,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3729). For example:

  ```c++
  #include <filesystem>
  #include <fmt/std.h>

  int main() {
    fmt::print("{:g}\n", std::filesystem::path("C:\\foo"));
  }
  ```

  prints `"C:/foo"` on Windows.

  Thanks @js324.

- Made `format_as` work with references
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3739). Thanks @tchaikov.

- Fixed formatting of invalid UTF-8 with precision
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3284).

- Fixed an inconsistency between `fmt::to_string` and `fmt::format`
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3684).

- Disallowed unsafe uses of `fmt::styled`
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3625):

  ```c++
  auto s = fmt::styled(std::string("dangle"), fmt::emphasis::bold);
  fmt::print("{}\n", s); // compile error
  ```

  Pass `fmt::styled(...)` as a parameter instead.

- Added a null check when formatting a C string with the `s` specifier
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3706).

- Disallowed the `c` specifier for `bool`
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3726,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3734). Thanks @js324.

- Made the default formatting unlocalized in `fmt::ostream_formatter` for
  consistency with the rest of the library
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3460).

- Fixed localized formatting in bases other than decimal
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3693,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3750). Thanks @js324.

- Fixed a performance regression in experimental `fmt::ostream::print`
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3674).

- Added synchronization with the underlying output stream when writing to
  the Windows console
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3668,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3688,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3689).
  Thanks @Roman-Koshelev and @dimztimz.

- Changed to only export `format_error` when {fmt} is built as a shared
  library (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3626,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3627). Thanks @phprus.

- Made `fmt::streamed` `constexpr`.
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3650). Thanks @muggenhor.

- Made `fmt::format_int` `constexpr`
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/4031,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4032). Thanks @dixlorenz.

# 10.0.0 - 2023-05-09

- Replaced Grisu with a new floating-point formatting algorithm for
  given precision (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3262,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2750,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3269,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3276). The new algorithm
  is based on Dragonbox already used for the shortest representation
  and gives substantial performance improvement:

  ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33922675/211956670-84891a09-6867-47d9-82fc-3230da7abe0f.png)

  -   Red: new algorithm
  -   Green: new algorithm with `FMT_USE_FULL_CACHE_DRAGONBOX` defined
      to 1
  -   Blue: old algorithm

  Thanks @jk-jeon.

- Replaced `snprintf`-based hex float formatter with an internal
  implementation (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3179,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3203). This removes the
  last usage of `s(n)printf` in {fmt}. Thanks @phprus.

- Fixed alignment of floating-point numbers with localization
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3263,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3272). Thanks @ShawnZhong.

- Made handling of `#` consistent with `std::format`.

- Improved C++20 module support
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3134,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3254,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3386,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3387,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3388,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3392,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3397,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3399,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3400).
  Thanks @laitingsheng, @Orvid and @DanielaE.
  
- Switched to the [modules CMake library](https://github.com/vitaut/modules)
  which allows building {fmt} as a C++20 module with clang:

      CXX=clang++ cmake -DFMT_MODULE=ON .
      make

- Made `format_as` work with any user-defined type and not just enums.
  For example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/b7rqhq5Kh)):

  ```c++
  #include <fmt/format.h>

  struct floaty_mc_floatface {
    double value;
  };

  auto format_as(floaty_mc_floatface f) { return f.value; }

  int main() {
    fmt::print("{:8}\n", floaty_mc_floatface{0.42}); // prints "    0.42"
  }
  ```

- Removed deprecated implicit conversions for enums and conversions to
  primitive types for compatibility with `std::format` and to prevent
  potential ODR violations. Use `format_as` instead.

- Added support for fill, align and width to the time point formatter
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3237,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3260,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3275). For example
  ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/rKP6MGz6c)):

  ```c++
  #include <fmt/chrono.h>

  int main() {
    // prints "    2023"
    fmt::print("{:>8%Y}\n", std::chrono::system_clock::now());
  }
  ```

  Thanks @ShawnZhong.

- Implemented formatting of subseconds
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2207,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3117,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3115,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3143,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3144,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3349). For example
  ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/45738oGEo)):

  ```c++
  #include <fmt/chrono.h>

  int main() {
    // prints 01.234567
    fmt::print("{:%S}\n", std::chrono::microseconds(1234567));
  }
  ```

  Thanks @patrickroocks @phprus and @BRevzin.

- Added support for `%Ez` and `%Oz` to chrono formatters.
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3220,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3222). Thanks @phprus.

- Improved validation of format specifiers for `std::chrono::duration`
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3219,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3232). Thanks @ShawnZhong.

- Fixed formatting of time points before the epoch
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3117,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3261). For example
  ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/f7bcznb3W)):

  ```c++
  #include <fmt/chrono.h>

  int main() {
    auto t = std::chrono::system_clock::from_time_t(0) -
             std::chrono::milliseconds(250);
    fmt::print("{:%S}\n", t); // prints 59.750000000
  }
  ```

  Thanks @ShawnZhong.

- Experimental: implemented glibc extension for padding seconds,
  minutes and hours
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2959,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3271). Thanks @ShawnZhong.

- Added a formatter for `std::exception`
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2977,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3012,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3062,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3076,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3119). For example
  ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/8xoWGs9e4)):

  ```c++
  #include <fmt/std.h>
  #include <vector>

  int main() {
    try {
      std::vector<bool>().at(0);
    } catch(const std::exception& e) {
      fmt::print("{}", e);
    }
  }
  ```

  prints:

      vector<bool>::_M_range_check: __n (which is 0) >= this->size() (which is 0)

  on libstdc++. Thanks @zach2good and @phprus.

- Moved `std::error_code` formatter from `fmt/os.h` to `fmt/std.h`.
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3125). Thanks @phprus.

- Added formatters for standard container adapters:
  `std::priority_queue`, `std::queue` and `std::stack`
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3215,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3279). For example
  ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/74h1xY9qK)):

  ```c++
  #include <fmt/ranges.h>
  #include <stack>
  #include <vector>

  int main() {
    auto s = std::stack<bool, std::vector<bool>>();
    for (auto b: {true, false, true}) s.push(b);
    fmt::print("{}\n", s); // prints [true, false, true]
  }
  ```

  Thanks @ShawnZhong.

  ```c++
  #include <fmt/compile.h>

  int main() {
    using namespace fmt::literals;
    constexpr size_t n = fmt::formatted_size("{}"_cf, 42);
    fmt::print("{}\n", n); // prints 2
  }
  ```

  Thanks @marksantaniello.

# 9.0.0 - 2022-07-04

- Switched to the internal floating point formatter for all decimal
  presentation formats. In particular this results in consistent
  rounding on all platforms and removing the `s[n]printf` fallback for
  decimal FP formatting.

- Compile-time floating point formatting no longer requires the
  header-only mode. For example
  ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/G37PTeG3b)):

  ```c++
  #include <array>
  #include <fmt/compile.h>

  consteval auto compile_time_dtoa(double value) -> std::array<char, 10> {
    auto result = std::array<char, 10>();
    fmt::format_to(result.data(), FMT_COMPILE("{}"), value);
    return result;
  }

  constexpr auto answer = compile_time_dtoa(0.42);
  ```

  works with the default settings.

- Improved the implementation of
  [Dragonbox](https://github.com/jk-jeon/dragonbox), the algorithm
  used for the default floating-point formatting
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2713,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2750). Thanks @jk-jeon.

- Made `fmt::to_string` work with `__float128`. This uses the internal
  FP formatter and works even on system without `__float128` support
  in `[s]printf`.

- Disabled automatic `std::ostream` insertion operator (`operator<<`)
  discovery when `fmt/ostream.h` is included to prevent ODR
  violations. You can get the old behavior by defining
  `FMT_DEPRECATED_OSTREAM` but this will be removed in the next major
  release. Use `fmt::streamed` or `fmt::ostream_formatter` to enable
  formatting via `std::ostream` instead.

- Added `fmt::ostream_formatter` that can be used to write `formatter`
  specializations that perform formatting via `std::ostream`. For
  example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/5sEc5qMsf)):

  ```c++
  #include <fmt/ostream.h>

  struct date {
    int year, month, day;

    friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, const date& d) {
      return os << d.year << '-' << d.month << '-' << d.day;
    }
  };

  template <> struct fmt::formatter<date> : ostream_formatter {};

  std::string s = fmt::format("The date is {}", date{2012, 12, 9});
  // s == "The date is 2012-12-9"
  ```

- Added the `fmt::streamed` function that takes an object and formats
  it via `std::ostream`. For example
  ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/5G3346G1f)):

  ```c++
  #include <thread>
  #include <fmt/ostream.h>

  int main() {
    fmt::print("Current thread id: {}\n",
               fmt::streamed(std::this_thread::get_id()));
  }
  ```

  Note that `fmt/std.h` provides a `formatter` specialization for
  `std::thread::id` so you don\'t need to format it via
  `std::ostream`.

- Deprecated implicit conversions of unscoped enums to integers for
  consistency with scoped enums.

- Added an argument-dependent lookup based `format_as` extension API
  to simplify formatting of enums.

- Added experimental `std::variant` formatting support
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2941). For example
  ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/KG9z6cq68)):

  ```c++
  #include <variant>
  #include <fmt/std.h>

  int main() {
    auto v = std::variant<int, std::string>(42);
    fmt::print("{}\n", v);
  }
  ```

  prints:

      variant(42)

  Thanks @jehelset.

- Added experimental `std::filesystem::path` formatting support
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2865,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2902,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2917,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2918). For example
  ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/o44dMexEb)):

  ```c++
  #include <filesystem>
  #include <fmt/std.h>

  int main() {
    fmt::print("There is no place like {}.", std::filesystem::path("/home"));
  }
  ```

  prints:

      There is no place like "/home".

  Thanks @phprus.

- Added a `std::thread::id` formatter to `fmt/std.h`. For example
  ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/j1azbYf3E)):

  ```c++
  #include <thread>
  #include <fmt/std.h>

  int main() {
    fmt::print("Current thread id: {}\n", std::this_thread::get_id());
  }
  ```

- Added `fmt::styled` that applies a text style to an individual
  argument (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2793). For
  example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/vWGW7v5M6)):

  ```c++
  #include <fmt/chrono.h>
  #include <fmt/color.h>

  int main() {
    auto now = std::chrono::system_clock::now();
    fmt::print(
      "[{}] {}: {}\n",
      fmt::styled(now, fmt::emphasis::bold),
      fmt::styled("error", fg(fmt::color::red)),
      "something went wrong");
  }
  ```

  prints

  Thanks @rbrugo.

- Made `fmt::print` overload for text styles correctly handle UTF-8
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2681,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2701). Thanks @AlexGuteniev.

- Fixed Unicode handling when writing to an ostream.

- Added support for nested specifiers to range formatting
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2673). For example
  ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/xd3Gj38cf)):

  ```c++
  #include <vector>
  #include <fmt/ranges.h>

  int main() {
    fmt::print("{::#x}\n", std::vector{10, 20, 30});
  }
  ```

  prints `[0xa, 0x14, 0x1e]`.

  Thanks @BRevzin.

- Implemented escaping of wide strings in ranges
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2904). Thanks @phprus.

- Added support for ranges with `begin` / `end` found via the
  argument-dependent lookup
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2807). Thanks @rbrugo.

- Fixed formatting of certain kinds of ranges of ranges
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2787). Thanks @BRevzin.

- Fixed handling of maps with element types other than `std::pair`
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2944). Thanks @BrukerJWD.

- Made tuple formatter enabled only if elements are formattable
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2939,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2940). Thanks @jehelset.

- Made `fmt::join` compatible with format string compilation
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2719,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2720). Thanks @phprus.

- Made compile-time checks work with named arguments of custom types
  and `std::ostream` `print` overloads
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2816,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2817,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2819). Thanks @timsong-cpp.

- Removed `make_args_checked` because it is no longer needed for
  compile-time checks
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2760). Thanks @phprus.

- Removed the following deprecated APIs: `_format`, `arg_join`, the
  `format_to` overload that takes a memory buffer, `[v]fprintf` that
  takes an `ostream`.

- Removed the deprecated implicit conversion of `[const] signed char*`
  and `[const] unsigned char*` to C strings.

- Removed the deprecated `fmt/locale.h`.

- Replaced the deprecated `fileno()` with `descriptor()` in
  `buffered_file`.

- Moved `to_string_view` to the `detail` namespace since it\'s an
  implementation detail.

- Made access mode of a created file consistent with `fopen` by
  setting `S_IWGRP` and `S_IWOTH`
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2733). Thanks @arogge.

- Removed a redundant buffer resize when formatting to `std::ostream`
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2842,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2843). Thanks @jcelerier.

- Made precision computation for strings consistent with width
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2888).

- Fixed handling of locale separators in floating point formatting
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2830).

- Made sign specifiers work with `__int128_t`
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2773).

- Improved support for systems such as CHERI with extra data stored in
  pointers (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2932).
  Thanks @davidchisnall.

- Improved documentation
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2706,

# 8.1.1 - 2022-01-06

- Restored ABI compatibility with version 8.0.x
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2695,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2696). Thanks @saraedum.
- Fixed chrono formatting on big endian systems
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2698,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2699).
  Thanks @phprus and @xvitaly.
- Fixed a linkage error with mingw
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2691,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2692). Thanks @rbberger.

# 8.1.0 - 2022-01-02

- Optimized chrono formatting
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2500,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2537,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2541,

  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2671).

  Processing of some specifiers such as `%z` and `%Y` is now up to
  10-20 times faster, for example on GCC 11 with libstdc++:

      ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Benchmark                                  Before             After
      ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
      FMTFormatter_z                             261 ns             26.3 ns
      FMTFormatterCompile_z                      246 ns             11.6 ns
      FMTFormatter_Y                             263 ns             26.1 ns
      FMTFormatterCompile_Y                      244 ns             10.5 ns
      ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Thanks @phprus and @toughengineer.

- Implemented subsecond formatting for chrono durations
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2623). For example
  ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/es7vWTETe)):

  ```c++
  #include <fmt/chrono.h>

  int main() {
    fmt::print("{:%S}", std::chrono::milliseconds(1234));
  }
  ```

  prints \"01.234\".

  Thanks @matrackif.

- Fixed handling of precision 0 when formatting chrono durations
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2587,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2588). Thanks @lukester1975.

- Fixed an overflow on invalid inputs in the `tm` formatter
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2564). Thanks @phprus.

- Added `fmt::group_digits` that formats integers with a non-localized
  digit separator (comma) for groups of three digits. For example
  ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/TxGxG9Poq)):

  ```c++
  #include <fmt/format.h>

  int main() {
    fmt::print("{} dollars", fmt::group_digits(1000000));
  }
  ```

  prints \"1,000,000 dollars\".

- Added support for faint, conceal, reverse and blink text styles
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2394):

  <https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/576385/147710227-c68f5317-f8fa-42c3-9123-7c4ba3c398cb.mp4>

  Thanks @benit8 and @data-man.

- Added experimental support for compile-time floating point
  formatting (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2426,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2470). It is currently
  limited to the header-only mode. Thanks @alexezeder.

- Added UDL-based named argument support to compile-time format string
  checks (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2640,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2649). For example
  ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/ohGbbvonv)):

  ```c++
  #include <fmt/format.h>

  int main() {
    using namespace fmt::literals;
    fmt::print("{answer:s}", "answer"_a=42);
  }
  ```

  gives a compile-time error on compilers with C++20 `consteval` and
  non-type template parameter support (gcc 10+) because `s` is not a
  valid format specifier for an integer.

  Thanks @alexezeder.

- Implemented escaping of string range elements. For example
  ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/rKvM1vKf3)):

  ```c++
  #include <fmt/ranges.h>
  #include <vector>

  int main() {
    fmt::print("{}", std::vector<std::string>{"\naan"});
  }
  ```

  is now printed as:

      ["\naan"]

  instead of:

      ["
      aan"]

- Added an experimental `?` specifier for escaping strings.
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2674). Thanks @BRevzin.

- Switched to JSON-like representation of maps and sets for
  consistency with Python\'s `str.format`. For example
  ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/seKjoY9W5)):

  ```c++
  #include <fmt/ranges.h>
  #include <map>

  int main() {
    fmt::print("{}", std::map<std::string, int>{{"answer", 42}});
  }
  ```

  is now printed as:

      {"answer": 42}

- Extended `fmt::join` to support C++20-only ranges
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2549). Thanks @BRevzin.

- Optimized handling of non-const-iterable ranges and implemented
  initial support for non-const-formattable types.

- Disabled implicit conversions of scoped enums to integers that was
  accidentally introduced in earlier versions
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1841).

- Deprecated implicit conversion of `[const] signed char*` and
  `[const] unsigned char*` to C strings.

- Deprecated `_format`, a legacy UDL-based format API
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2646). Thanks @alexezeder.

- Marked `format`, `formatted_size` and `to_string` as `[[nodiscard]]`
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2612). @0x8000-0000.

- Added missing diagnostic when trying to format function and member
  pointers as well as objects convertible to pointers which is
  explicitly disallowed
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2598,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2609,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2610). Thanks @AlexGuteniev.

- Optimized writing to a contiguous buffer with `format_to_n`
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2489). Thanks @Roman-Koshelev.

- Optimized writing to non-`char` buffers
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2477). Thanks @Roman-Koshelev.

- Decimal point is now localized when using the `L` specifier.

- Improved floating point formatter implementation
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2498,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2499). Thanks @Roman-Koshelev.

- Fixed handling of very large precision in fixed format
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2616).

- Made a table of cached powers used in FP formatting static
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2509). Thanks @jk-jeon.

- Resolved a lookup ambiguity with C++20 format-related functions due
  to ADL (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2639,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2641). Thanks @mkurdej.

- Removed unnecessary inline namespace qualification
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2642,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2643). Thanks @mkurdej.

- Implemented argument forwarding in `format_to_n`
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2462,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2463). Thanks @owent.

- Fixed handling of implicit conversions in `fmt::to_string` and
  format string compilation
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2565).

- Changed the default access mode of files created by
  `fmt::output_file` to `-rw-r--r--` for consistency with `fopen`
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2530).

- Make `fmt::ostream::flush` public
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2435).

- Improved C++14/17 attribute detection
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2615). Thanks @AlexGuteniev.

- Improved `consteval` detection for MSVC
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2559). Thanks @DanielaE.

- Improved documentation
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2406,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2446,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2493,

  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2676).
  Thanks @sobolevn, @UnePierre, @zhsj, @phprus, @ericcurtin and @Lounarok.

- Improved fuzzers and added a fuzzer for chrono timepoint formatting
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2461,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2469). @pauldreik,

- Added the `FMT_SYSTEM_HEADERS` CMake option setting which marks
  {fmt}\'s headers as system. It can be used to suppress warnings
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2644,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2651). Thanks @alexezeder.

- Added the Bazel build system support
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2505,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2516). Thanks @Vertexwahn.

- Improved build configuration and tests
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2437,

# 8.0.1 - 2021-07-02

- Fixed the version number in the inline namespace
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2374).
- Added a missing presentation type check for `std::string`
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2402).
- Fixed a linkage error when mixing code built with clang and gcc
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2377).
- Fixed documentation issues

  Thanks @zx2c4, @AidanSun05, @mattiasljungstrom, @joemmett, @erengy,
  @patlkli, @gsjaardema and @phprus.

# 8.0.0 - 2021-06-21

- Enabled compile-time format string checks by default. For example
  ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/sMxcohGjz)):

  ```c++
  #include <fmt/core.h>

  int main() {
    fmt::print("{:d}", "I am not a number");
  }
  ```

  gives a compile-time error on compilers with C++20 `consteval`
  support (gcc 10+, clang 11+) because `d` is not a valid format
  specifier for a string.

  To pass a runtime string wrap it in `fmt::runtime`:

  ```c++
  fmt::print(fmt::runtime("{:d}"), "I am not a number");
  ```

- Added compile-time formatting
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2019,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2044,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2056,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2072,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2075,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2078,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2129,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2326). For example
  ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/Mxx9d89jM)):

  ```c++
  #include <fmt/compile.h>

  consteval auto compile_time_itoa(int value) -> std::array<char, 10> {
    auto result = std::array<char, 10>();
    fmt::format_to(result.data(), FMT_COMPILE("{}"), value);
    return result;
  }

  constexpr auto answer = compile_time_itoa(42);
  ```

  Most of the formatting functionality is available at compile time
  with a notable exception of floating-point numbers and pointers.
  Thanks @alexezeder.

- Optimized handling of format specifiers during format string
  compilation. For example, hexadecimal formatting (`"{:x}"`) is now
  3-7x faster than before when using `format_to` with format string
  compilation and a stack-allocated buffer
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1944).

  Before (7.1.3):

      ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Benchmark                                  Time             CPU   Iterations
      ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
      FMTCompileOld/0                         15.5 ns         15.5 ns     43302898
      FMTCompileOld/42                        16.6 ns         16.6 ns     43278267
      FMTCompileOld/273123                    18.7 ns         18.6 ns     37035861
      FMTCompileOld/9223372036854775807       19.4 ns         19.4 ns     35243000
      ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  After (8.x):

      ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Benchmark                                  Time             CPU   Iterations
      ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
      FMTCompileNew/0                         1.99 ns         1.99 ns    360523686
      FMTCompileNew/42                        2.33 ns         2.33 ns    279865664
      FMTCompileNew/273123                    3.72 ns         3.71 ns    190230315
      FMTCompileNew/9223372036854775807       5.28 ns         5.26 ns    130711631
      ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  It is even faster than `std::to_chars` from libc++ compiled with
  clang on macOS:

      ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Benchmark                                  Time             CPU   Iterations
      ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
      ToChars/0                               4.42 ns         4.41 ns    160196630
      ToChars/42                              5.00 ns         4.98 ns    140735201
      ToChars/273123                          7.26 ns         7.24 ns     95784130
      ToChars/9223372036854775807             8.77 ns         8.75 ns     75872534
      ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In other cases, especially involving `std::string` construction, the
  speed up is usually lower because handling format specifiers takes a
  smaller fraction of the total time.

- Added the `_cf` user-defined literal to represent a compiled format
  string. It can be used instead of the `FMT_COMPILE` macro
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2043,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2242):

  ```c++
  #include <fmt/compile.h>

  using namespace fmt::literals;
  auto s = fmt::format(FMT_COMPILE("{}"), 42); // 🙁 not modern
  auto s = fmt::format("{}"_cf, 42);           // 🙂 modern as hell
  ```

  It requires compiler support for class types in non-type template
  parameters (a C++20 feature) which is available in GCC 9.3+.
  Thanks @alexezeder.

- Format string compilation now requires `format` functions of
  `formatter` specializations for user-defined types to be `const`:

  ```c++
  template <> struct fmt::formatter<my_type>: formatter<string_view> {
    template <typename FormatContext>
    auto format(my_type obj, FormatContext& ctx) const {  // Note const here.
      // ...
    }
  };
  ```

- Added UDL-based named argument support to format string compilation
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2243,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2281). For example:

  ```c++
  #include <fmt/compile.h>

  using namespace fmt::literals;
  auto s = fmt::format(FMT_COMPILE("{answer}"), "answer"_a = 42);
  ```

  Here the argument named \"answer\" is resolved at compile time with
  no runtime overhead. Thanks @alexezeder.

- Added format string compilation support to `fmt::print`
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2280,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2304). Thanks @alexezeder.

- Added initial support for compiling {fmt} as a C++20 module
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2235,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2240,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2260,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2282,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2283,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2288,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2298,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2306,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2307,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2309,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2318,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2324,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2332,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2340). Thanks @DanielaE.

- Made symbols private by default reducing shared library size
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2301). For example
  there was a \~15% reported reduction on one platform. Thanks @sergiud.

- Optimized includes making the result of preprocessing `fmt/format.h`
  \~20% smaller with libstdc++/C++20 and slightly improving build
  times (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1998).

- Added support of ranges with non-const `begin` / `end`
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1953). Thanks @kitegi.

- Added support of `std::byte` and other formattable types to
  `fmt::join` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1981,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2040,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2050,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2262). For example:

  ```c++
  #include <fmt/format.h>
  #include <cstddef>
  #include <vector>

  int main() {
    auto bytes = std::vector{std::byte(4), std::byte(2)};
    fmt::print("{}", fmt::join(bytes, ""));
  }
  ```

  prints \"42\".

  Thanks @kamibo.

- Implemented the default format for `std::chrono::system_clock`
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2319,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2345). For example:

  ```c++
  #include <fmt/chrono.h>

  int main() {
    fmt::print("{}", std::chrono::system_clock::now());
  }
  ```

  prints \"2021-06-18 15:22:00\" (the output depends on the current
  date and time). Thanks @sunmy2019.

- Made more chrono specifiers locale independent by default. Use the
  `'L'` specifier to get localized formatting. For example:

  ```c++
  #include <fmt/chrono.h>

  int main() {
    std::locale::global(std::locale("ru_RU.UTF-8"));
    auto monday = std::chrono::weekday(1);
    fmt::print("{}\n", monday);   // prints "Mon"
    fmt::print("{:L}\n", monday); // prints "пн"
  }
  ```

- Improved locale handling in chrono formatting
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2337,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2349,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2350). Thanks @phprus.

- Deprecated `fmt/locale.h` moving the formatting functions that take
  a locale to `fmt/format.h` (`char`) and `fmt/xchar` (other
  overloads). This doesn\'t introduce a dependency on `<locale>` so
  there is virtually no compile time effect.

- Deprecated an undocumented `format_to` overload that takes
  `basic_memory_buffer`.

- Made parameter order in `vformat_to` consistent with `format_to`
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2327).

- Added support for time points with arbitrary durations
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2208). For example:

  ```c++
  #include <fmt/chrono.h>

  int main() {
    using tp = std::chrono::time_point<
      std::chrono::system_clock, std::chrono::seconds>;
    fmt::print("{:%S}", tp(std::chrono::seconds(42)));
  }
  ```

  prints \"42\".

- Formatting floating-point numbers no longer produces trailing zeros
  by default for consistency with `std::format`. For example:

  ```c++
  #include <fmt/core.h>

  int main() {
    fmt::print("{0:.3}", 1.1);
  }
  ```

  prints \"1.1\". Use the `'#'` specifier to keep trailing zeros.

- Dropped a limit on the number of elements in a range and replaced
  `{}` with `[]` as range delimiters for consistency with Python\'s
  `str.format`.

- The `'L'` specifier for locale-specific numeric formatting can now
  be combined with presentation specifiers as in `std::format`. For
  example:

  ```c++
  #include <fmt/core.h>
  #include <locale>

  int main() {
    std::locale::global(std::locale("fr_FR.UTF-8"));
    fmt::print("{0:.2Lf}", 0.42);
  }
  ```

  prints \"0,42\". The deprecated `'n'` specifier has been removed.

- Made the `0` specifier ignored for infinity and NaN
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2305,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2310). Thanks @Liedtke.

- Made the hexfloat formatting use the right alignment by default
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2308,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2317). Thanks @Liedtke.

- Removed the deprecated numeric alignment (`'='`). Use the `'0'`
  specifier instead.

- Removed the deprecated `fmt/posix.h` header that has been replaced
  with `fmt/os.h`.

- Removed the deprecated `format_to_n_context`, `format_to_n_args` and
  `make_format_to_n_args`. They have been replaced with
  `format_context`, `` format_args` and ``make_format_args\`\`
  respectively.

- Moved `wchar_t`-specific functions and types to `fmt/xchar.h`. You
  can define `FMT_DEPRECATED_INCLUDE_XCHAR` to automatically include
  `fmt/xchar.h` from `fmt/format.h` but this will be disabled in the
  next major release.

- Fixed handling of the `'+'` specifier in localized formatting
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2133).

- Added support for the `'s'` format specifier that gives textual
  representation of `bool`
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2094,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2109). For example:

  ```c++
  #include <fmt/core.h>

  int main() {
    fmt::print("{:s}", true);
  }
  ```

  prints \"true\". Thanks @powercoderlol.

- Made `fmt::ptr` work with function pointers
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2131). For example:

  ```c++
  #include <fmt/format.h>

  int main() {
    fmt::print("My main: {}\n", fmt::ptr(main));
  }
  ```

  Thanks @mikecrowe.

- The undocumented support for specializing `formatter` for pointer
  types has been removed.

- Fixed `fmt::formatted_size` with format string compilation
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2141,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2161). Thanks @alexezeder.

- Fixed handling of empty format strings during format string
  compilation (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2042):

  ```c++
  auto s = fmt::format(FMT_COMPILE(""));
  ```

  Thanks @alexezeder.

- Fixed handling of enums in `fmt::to_string`
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2036).

- Improved width computation
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2033,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2091). For example:

  ```c++
  #include <fmt/core.h>

  int main() {
    fmt::print("{:-<10}{}\n", "你好", "世界");
    fmt::print("{:-<10}{}\n", "hello", "world");
  }
  ```

  prints

  ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/576385/119840373-cea3ca80-beb9-11eb-91e0-54266c48e181.png)

  on a modern terminal.

- The experimental fast output stream (`fmt::ostream`) is now
  truncated by default for consistency with `fopen`
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2018). For example:

  ```c++
  #include <fmt/os.h>

  int main() {
    fmt::ostream out1 = fmt::output_file("guide");
    out1.print("Zaphod");
    out1.close();
    fmt::ostream out2 = fmt::output_file("guide");
    out2.print("Ford");
  }
  ```

  writes \"Ford\" to the file \"guide\". To preserve the old file
  content if any pass `fmt::file::WRONLY | fmt::file::CREATE` flags to
  `fmt::output_file`.

- Fixed moving of `fmt::ostream` that holds buffered data
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2197,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2198). Thanks @vtta.

- Replaced the `fmt::system_error` exception with a function of the
  same name that constructs `std::system_error`
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2266).

- Replaced the `fmt::windows_error` exception with a function of the
  same name that constructs `std::system_error` with the category
  returned by `fmt::system_category()`
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2274,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2275). The latter is
  similar to `std::system_category` but correctly handles UTF-8.
  Thanks @phprus.

- Replaced `fmt::error_code` with `std::error_code` and made it
  formattable (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2269,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2270,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2273). Thanks @phprus.

- Added speech synthesis support
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2206).

- Made `format_to` work with a memory buffer that has a custom
  allocator (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2300).
  Thanks @voxmea.

- Added `Allocator::max_size` support to `basic_memory_buffer`.
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1960). Thanks @phprus.

- Added wide string support to `fmt::join`
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2236). Thanks @crbrz.

- Made iterators passed to `formatter` specializations via a format
  context satisfy C++20 `std::output_iterator` requirements
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2156,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2158,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2195,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2204). Thanks @randomnetcat.

- Optimized the `printf` implementation
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1982,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1984,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2016,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2164).
  Thanks @rimathia and @moiwi.

- Improved detection of `constexpr` `char_traits`
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2246,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2257). Thanks @phprus.

- Fixed writing to `stdout` when it is redirected to `NUL` on Windows
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2080).

- Fixed exception propagation from iterators
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2097).

- Improved `strftime` error handling
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2238,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2244). Thanks @yumeyao.

- Stopped using deprecated GCC UDL template extension.

- Added `fmt/args.h` to the install target
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2096).

- Error messages are now passed to assert when exceptions are disabled
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2145). Thanks @NobodyXu.

- Added the `FMT_MASTER_PROJECT` CMake option to control build and
  install targets when {fmt} is included via `add_subdirectory`
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2098,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2100).
  Thanks @randomizedthinking.

- Improved build configuration
  (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2026,
  https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2122).
  Thanks @luncliff and @ibaned.

- Fixed various warnings and compilation issues
