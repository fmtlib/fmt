# Features

- Simple [format API](https://fmt.dev/latest/api.html) with positional
  arguments for localization
- Implementation of [C++20
  std::format](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/format) and
  [C++23 std::print](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/print)
- [Format string syntax](https://fmt.dev/latest/syntax.html) similar
  to Python\'s
  [format](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format)
- Fast IEEE 754 floating-point formatter with correct rounding,
  shortness and round-trip guarantees using the
  [Dragonbox](https://github.com/jk-jeon/dragonbox) algorithm
- Portable Unicode support
- Safe [printf
  implementation](https://fmt.dev/latest/api.html#printf-formatting)
  including the POSIX extension for positional arguments
- Extensibility: [support for user-defined
  types](https://fmt.dev/latest/api.html#formatting-user-defined-types)
- High performance: faster than common standard library
  implementations of `(s)printf`, iostreams, `to_string` and
  `to_chars`, see [Speed tests](#speed-tests) and [Converting a
  hundred million integers to strings per
  second](http://www.zverovich.net/2020/06/13/fast-int-to-string-revisited.html)
- Small code size both in terms of source code with the minimum
  configuration consisting of just three files, `core.h`, `format.h`
  and `format-inl.h`, and compiled code; see [Compile time and code
  bloat](#compile-time-and-code-bloat)
- Reliability: the library has an extensive set of
  [tests](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/tree/master/test) and is

- Optional header-only configuration enabled with the
  `FMT_HEADER_ONLY` macro

See the [documentation](https://fmt.dev) for more details.

# Examples

**Print to stdout** ([run](https://godbolt.org/z/Tevcjh))

``` c++
#include <fmt/core.h>

int main() {
  fmt::print("Hello, world!\n");
}
```

**Format a string** ([run](https://godbolt.org/z/oK8h33))

``` c++
std::string s = fmt::format("The answer is {}.", 42);
// s == "The answer is 42."
```

**Format a string using positional arguments**
([run](https://godbolt.org/z/Yn7Txe))

``` c++
std::string s = fmt::format("I'd rather be {1} than {0}.", "right", "happy");
// s == "I'd rather be happy than right."
```

**Print dates and times** ([run](https://godbolt.org/z/c31ExdY3W))

``` c++
#include <fmt/chrono.h>

int main() {
  auto now = std::chrono::system_clock::now();
  fmt::print("Date and time: {}\n", now);
  fmt::print("Time: {:%H:%M}\n", now);
}
```

Output:

    Date and time: 2023-12-26 19:10:31.557195597
    Time: 19:10

**Print a container** ([run](https://godbolt.org/z/MxM1YqjE7))

``` c++
#include <vector>
#include <fmt/ranges.h>

int main() {
  std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3};
  fmt::print("{}\n", v);
}
```

Output:

    [1, 2, 3]

**Check a format string at compile time**

``` c++
std::string s = fmt::format("{:d}", "I am not a number");
```

This gives a compile-time error in C++20 because `d` is an invalid
format specifier for a string.

**Write a file from a single thread**

``` c++
#include <fmt/os.h>

int main() {
  auto out = fmt::output_file("guide.txt");
  out.print("Don't {}", "Panic");
}
```

This can be [5 to 9 times faster than
fprintf](http://www.zverovich.net/2020/08/04/optimal-file-buffer-size.html).

**Print with colors and text styles**

``` c++
#include <fmt/color.h>

int main() {
  fmt::print(fg(fmt::color::crimson) | fmt::emphasis::bold,
             "Hello, {}!\n", "world");
  fmt::print(fg(fmt::color::floral_white) | bg(fmt::color::slate_gray) |
             fmt::emphasis::underline, "Olá, {}!\n", "Mundo");
  fmt::print(fg(fmt::color::steel_blue) | fmt::emphasis::italic,
             "你好{}！\n", "世界");
}
```

Output on a modern terminal with Unicode support:

# Benchmarks

## Speed tests

| Library           | Method        | Run Time, s |
|-------------------|---------------|-------------|
| libc              | printf        |   0.91      |
| libc++            | std::ostream  |   2.49      |
| {fmt} 9.1         | fmt::print    |   0.74      |
| Boost Format 1.80 | boost::format |   6.26      |
| Folly Format      | folly::format |   1.87      |

{fmt} is the fastest of the benchmarked methods, \~20% faster than
`printf`.

The above results were generated by building `tinyformat_test.cpp` on
macOS 12.6.1 with `clang++ -O3 -DNDEBUG -DSPEED_TEST -DHAVE_FORMAT`, and
taking the best of three runs. In the test, the format string
`"%0.10f:%04d:%+g:%s:%p:%c:%%\n"` or equivalent is filled 2,000,000
times with output sent to `/dev/null`; for further details refer to the
[source](https://github.com/fmtlib/format-benchmark/blob/master/src/tinyformat-test.cc).

{fmt} is up to 20-30x faster than `std::ostringstream` and `sprintf` on
IEEE754 `float` and `double` formatting
([dtoa-benchmark](https://github.com/fmtlib/dtoa-benchmark)) and faster
than [double-conversion](https://github.com/google/double-conversion)
and [ryu](https://github.com/ulfjack/ryu):

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/576385/95684665-11719600-0ba8-11eb-8e5b-972ff4e49428.png)](https://fmt.dev/unknown_mac64_clang12.0.html)

## Compile time and code bloat

The script
[bloat-test.py](https://github.com/fmtlib/format-benchmark/blob/master/bloat-test.py)
from [format-benchmark](https://github.com/fmtlib/format-benchmark)
tests compile time and code bloat for nontrivial projects. It generates
100 translation units and uses `printf()` or its alternative five times
in each to simulate a medium-sized project. The resulting executable
size and compile time (Apple LLVM version 8.1.0 (clang-802.0.42), macOS
Sierra, best of three) is shown in the following tables.

**Optimized build (-O3)**

| Method        | Compile Time, s | Executable size, KiB | Stripped size, KiB |
|---------------|-----------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| printf        |   2.6           |   29                 |   26               |
| printf+string |   16.4          |   29                 |   26               |
| iostreams     |   31.1          |   59                 |   55               |
| {fmt}         |   19.0          |   37                 |   34               |
| Boost Format  |   91.9          |   226                |   203              |
| Folly Format  |   115.7         |   101                |   88               |

As you can see, {fmt} has 60% less overhead in terms of resulting binary
code size compared to iostreams and comes pretty close to `printf`.
Boost Format and Folly Format have the largest overheads.

`printf+string` is the same as `printf` but with an extra `<string>`
include to measure the overhead of the latter.

**Non-optimized build**

| Method        | Compile Time, s | Executable size, KiB | Stripped size, KiB |
|---------------|-----------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| printf        |   2.2           |   33                 |   30               |
| printf+string |   16.0          |   33                 |   30               |
| iostreams     |   28.3          |   56                 |   52               |
| {fmt}         |   18.2          |   59                 |   50               |
| Boost Format  |   54.1          |   365                |   303              |
| Folly Format  |   79.9          |   445                |   430              |

`libc`, `lib(std)c++`, and `libfmt` are all linked as shared libraries
to compare formatting function overhead only. Boost Format is a
header-only library so it doesn\'t provide any linkage options.

## Running the tests

Please refer to [Building the
library](https://fmt.dev/latest/usage.html#building-the-library) for
instructions on how to build the library and run the unit tests.

Benchmarks reside in a separate repository,
[format-benchmarks](https://github.com/fmtlib/format-benchmark), so to
run the benchmarks you first need to clone this repository and generate
Makefiles with CMake:

    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/fmtlib/format-benchmark.git
    $ cd format-benchmark
    $ cmake .

Then you can run the speed test:

    $ make speed-test

or the bloat test:

    $ make bloat-test

# Migrating code

[clang-tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/) v17 (not yet
released) provides the
[modernize-use-std-print](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/modernize/use-std-print.html)
check that is capable of converting occurrences of `printf` and
`fprintf` to `fmt::print` if configured to do so. (By default it
converts to `std::print`.)

# Motivation

So why yet another formatting library?

There are plenty of methods for doing this task, from standard ones like
the printf family of function and iostreams to Boost Format and
FastFormat libraries. The reason for creating a new library is that
every existing solution that I found either had serious issues or
didn\'t provide all the features I needed.

## printf

The good thing about `printf` is that it is pretty fast and readily
available being a part of the C standard library. The main drawback is
that it doesn\'t support user-defined types. `printf` also has safety
issues although they are somewhat mitigated with [\_\_attribute\_\_
((format (printf,
\...))](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Function-Attributes.html) in
GCC. There is a POSIX extension that adds positional arguments required
for
[i18n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization)
to `printf` but it is not a part of C99 and may not be available on some
platforms.

## iostreams

The main issue with iostreams is best illustrated with an example:

``` c++
std::cout << std::setprecision(2) << std::fixed << 1.23456 << "\n";
```

which is a lot of typing compared to printf:

``` c++
printf("%.2f\n", 1.23456);
```

Matthew Wilson, the author of FastFormat, called this \"chevron hell\".
iostreams don\'t support positional arguments by design.

The good part is that iostreams support user-defined types and are safe
although error handling is awkward.

## Boost Format

This is a very powerful library that supports both `printf`-like format
strings and positional arguments. Its main drawback is performance.
According to various benchmarks, it is much slower than other methods
considered here. Boost Format also has excessive build times and severe
code bloat issues (see [Benchmarks](#benchmarks)).

## FastFormat

This is an interesting library that is fast, safe and has positional
arguments. However, it has significant limitations, citing its author:

> Three features that have no hope of being accommodated within the
> current design are:
>
> - Leading zeros (or any other non-space padding)
> - Octal/hexadecimal encoding
> - Runtime width/alignment specification

It is also quite big and has a heavy dependency, on STLSoft, which might be
too restrictive for use in some projects.

## Boost Spirit.Karma

This is not a formatting library but I decided to include it here for
completeness. As iostreams, it suffers from the problem of mixing
verbatim text with arguments. The library is pretty fast, but slower on
integer formatting than `fmt::format_to` with format string compilation
on Karma\'s own benchmark, see [Converting a hundred million integers to
strings per
second](http://www.zverovich.net/2020/06/13/fast-int-to-string-revisited.html).
