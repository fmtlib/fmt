Features
--------

* Simple `format API <https://fmt.dev/latest/api.html>`_ with positional arguments
  for localization
* Implementation of `C++20 std::format
  <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/format>`__ and `C++23 std::print
  <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/print>`__
* `Format string syntax <https://fmt.dev/latest/syntax.html>`_ similar to Python's
  `format <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format>`_
* Fast IEEE 754 floating-point formatter with correct rounding, shortness and
  round-trip guarantees using the `Dragonbox <https://github.com/jk-jeon/dragonbox>`_
  algorithm
* Portable Unicode support
* Safe `printf implementation
  <https://fmt.dev/latest/api.html#printf-formatting>`_ including the POSIX
  extension for positional arguments
* Extensibility: `support for user-defined types
  <https://fmt.dev/latest/api.html#formatting-user-defined-types>`_
* High performance: faster than common standard library implementations of
  ``(s)printf``, iostreams, ``to_string`` and ``to_chars``, see `Speed tests`_
  and `Converting a hundred million integers to strings per second
  <http://www.zverovich.net/2020/06/13/fast-int-to-string-revisited.html>`_
* Small code size both in terms of source code with the minimum configuration
  consisting of just three files, ``core.h``, ``format.h`` and ``format-inl.h``,
  and compiled code; see `Compile time and code bloat`_
* Reliability: the library has an extensive set of `tests
  <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/tree/master/test>`_ and is `continuously fuzzed
  <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list?colspec=ID%20Type%20
  Component%20Status%20Proj%20Reported%20Owner%20Summary&q=proj%3Dfmt&can=1>`_
* Safety: the library is fully type-safe, errors in format strings can be
  reported at compile time, automatic memory management prevents buffer overflow
  errors
* Ease of use: small self-contained code base, no external dependencies,
  permissive MIT `license
  <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/blob/master/LICENSE.rst>`_
* `Portability <https://fmt.dev/latest/index.html#portability>`_ with
  consistent output across platforms and support for older compilers
* Clean warning-free codebase even on high warning levels such as
  ``-Wall -Wextra -pedantic``
* Locale independence by default
* Optional header-only configuration enabled with the ``FMT_HEADER_ONLY`` macro

See the `documentation <https://fmt.dev>`_ for more details.

Examples
--------

**Print to stdout** (`run <https://godbolt.org/z/Tevcjh>`_)

.. code:: c++

    #include <fmt/core.h>

    int main() {
      fmt::print("Hello, world!\n");
    }

**Format a string** (`run <https://godbolt.org/z/oK8h33>`_)

.. code:: c++

    std::string s = fmt::format("The answer is {}.", 42);
    // s == "The answer is 42."

**Format a string using positional arguments** (`run <https://godbolt.org/z/Yn7Txe>`_)

.. code:: c++

    std::string s = fmt::format("I'd rather be {1} than {0}.", "right", "happy");
    // s == "I'd rather be happy than right."

**Print chrono durations** (`run <https://godbolt.org/z/K8s4Mc>`_)

.. code:: c++

    #include <fmt/chrono.h>

    int main() {
      using namespace std::literals::chrono_literals;
      fmt::print("Default format: {} {}\n", 42s, 100ms);
      fmt::print("strftime-like format: {:%H:%M:%S}\n", 3h + 15min + 30s);
    }

Output::

    Default format: 42s 100ms
    strftime-like format: 03:15:30

**Print a container** (`run <https://godbolt.org/z/MxM1YqjE7>`_)

.. code:: c++

    #include <vector>
    #include <fmt/ranges.h>

    int main() {
      std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3};
      fmt::print("{}\n", v);
    }

Output::

    [1, 2, 3]

**Check a format string at compile time**

.. code:: c++

    std::string s = fmt::format("{:d}", "I am not a number");

This gives a compile-time error in C++20 because ``d`` is an invalid format
specifier for a string.

**Write a file from a single thread**

.. code:: c++

    #include <fmt/os.h>

    int main() {
      auto out = fmt::output_file("guide.txt");
      out.print("Don't {}", "Panic");
    }

This can be `5 to 9 times faster than fprintf
<http://www.zverovich.net/2020/08/04/optimal-file-buffer-size.html>`_.

**Print with colors and text styles**

.. code:: c++

    #include <fmt/color.h>

    int main() {
      fmt::print(fg(fmt::color::crimson) | fmt::emphasis::bold,
                 "Hello, {}!\n", "world");
      fmt::print(fg(fmt::color::floral_white) | bg(fmt::color::slate_gray) |
                 fmt::emphasis::underline, "Olá, {}!\n", "Mundo");
      fmt::print(fg(fmt::color::steel_blue) | fmt::emphasis::italic,
                 "你好{}！\n", "世界");
    }

Output on a modern terminal with Unicode support:

Benchmarks
----------

Speed tests
~~~~~~~~~~~

================= ============= ===========
Library           Method        Run Time, s
================= ============= ===========
libc              printf          0.91
libc++            std::ostream    2.49
{fmt} 9.1         fmt::print      0.74
Boost Format 1.80 boost::format   6.26
Folly Format      folly::format   1.87
================= ============= ===========

{fmt} is the fastest of the benchmarked methods, ~20% faster than ``printf``.

The above results were generated by building ``tinyformat_test.cpp`` on macOS
12.6.1 with ``clang++ -O3 -DNDEBUG -DSPEED_TEST -DHAVE_FORMAT``, and taking the
best of three runs. In the test, the format string ``"%0.10f:%04d:%+g:%s:%p:%c:%%\n"``
or equivalent is filled 2,000,000 times with output sent to ``/dev/null``; for
further details refer to the `source
<https://github.com/fmtlib/format-benchmark/blob/master/src/tinyformat-test.cc>`_.

{fmt} is up to 20-30x faster than ``std::ostringstream`` and ``sprintf`` on
IEEE754 ``float`` and ``double`` formatting (`dtoa-benchmark <https://github.com/fmtlib/dtoa-benchmark>`_)
and faster than `double-conversion <https://github.com/google/double-conversion>`_ and
`ryu <https://github.com/ulfjack/ryu>`_:

   :target: https://fmt.dev/unknown_mac64_clang12.0.html

Compile time and code bloat
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The script `bloat-test.py
<https://github.com/fmtlib/format-benchmark/blob/master/bloat-test.py>`_
from `format-benchmark <https://github.com/fmtlib/format-benchmark>`_
tests compile time and code bloat for nontrivial projects.
It generates 100 translation units and uses ``printf()`` or its alternative
five times in each to simulate a medium-sized project.  The resulting
executable size and compile time (Apple LLVM version 8.1.0 (clang-802.0.42),
macOS Sierra, best of three) is shown in the following tables.

**Optimized build (-O3)**

============= =============== ==================== ==================
Method        Compile Time, s Executable size, KiB Stripped size, KiB
============= =============== ==================== ==================
printf                    2.6                   29                 26
printf+string            16.4                   29                 26
iostreams                31.1                   59                 55
{fmt}                    19.0                   37                 34
Boost Format             91.9                  226                203
Folly Format            115.7                  101                 88
============= =============== ==================== ==================

As you can see, {fmt} has 60% less overhead in terms of resulting binary code
size compared to iostreams and comes pretty close to ``printf``. Boost Format
and Folly Format have the largest overheads.

``printf+string`` is the same as ``printf`` but with an extra ``<string>``
include to measure the overhead of the latter.

**Non-optimized build**

============= =============== ==================== ==================
Method        Compile Time, s Executable size, KiB Stripped size, KiB
============= =============== ==================== ==================
printf                    2.2                   33                 30
printf+string            16.0                   33                 30
iostreams                28.3                   56                 52
{fmt}                    18.2                   59                 50
Boost Format             54.1                  365                303
Folly Format             79.9                  445                430
============= =============== ==================== ==================

``libc``, ``lib(std)c++``, and ``libfmt`` are all linked as shared libraries to
compare formatting function overhead only. Boost Format is a
header-only library so it doesn't provide any linkage options.

Running the tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please refer to `Building the library`__ for instructions on how to build
the library and run the unit tests.

__ https://fmt.dev/latest/usage.html#building-the-library

Benchmarks reside in a separate repository,
`format-benchmarks <https://github.com/fmtlib/format-benchmark>`_,
so to run the benchmarks you first need to clone this repository and
generate Makefiles with CMake::

    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/fmtlib/format-benchmark.git
    $ cd format-benchmark
    $ cmake .

Then you can run the speed test::

    $ make speed-test

or the bloat test::

    $ make bloat-test

Migrating code
--------------

`clang-tidy <https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/>`_ v17 (not yet
released) provides the `modernize-use-std-print
<https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/modernize/use-std-print.html>`_
check that is capable of converting occurrences of ``printf`` and
``fprintf`` to ``fmt::print`` if configured to do so. (By default it
converts to ``std::print``.)

Motivation
----------

So why yet another formatting library?

There are plenty of methods for doing this task, from standard ones like
the printf family of function and iostreams to Boost Format and FastFormat
libraries. The reason for creating a new library is that every existing
solution that I found either had serious issues or didn't provide
all the features I needed.

printf
~~~~~~

The good thing about ``printf`` is that it is pretty fast and readily available
being a part of the C standard library. The main drawback is that it
doesn't support user-defined types. ``printf`` also has safety issues although
they are somewhat mitigated with `__attribute__ ((format (printf, ...))
<https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Function-Attributes.html>`_ in GCC.
There is a POSIX extension that adds positional arguments required for
`i18n <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization>`_
to ``printf`` but it is not a part of C99 and may not be available on some
platforms.

iostreams
~~~~~~~~~

The main issue with iostreams is best illustrated with an example:

.. code:: c++

    std::cout << std::setprecision(2) << std::fixed << 1.23456 << "\n";

which is a lot of typing compared to printf:

.. code:: c++

    printf("%.2f\n", 1.23456);

Matthew Wilson, the author of FastFormat, called this "chevron hell". iostreams
don't support positional arguments by design.

The good part is that iostreams support user-defined types and are safe although
error handling is awkward.

Boost Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a very powerful library that supports both ``printf``-like format
strings and positional arguments. Its main drawback is performance. According to
various benchmarks, it is much slower than other methods considered here. Boost
Format also has excessive build times and severe code bloat issues (see
`Benchmarks`_).

FastFormat
~~~~~~~~~~

This is an interesting library that is fast, safe, and has positional arguments.
However, it has significant limitations, citing its author:

    Three features that have no hope of being accommodated within the
    current design are:

    * Leading zeros (or any other non-space padding)
    * Octal/hexadecimal encoding
    * Runtime width/alignment specification

It is also quite big and has a heavy dependency, STLSoft, which might be too
restrictive for using it in some projects.

Boost Spirit.Karma
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is not a formatting library but I decided to include it here for
completeness. As iostreams, it suffers from the problem of mixing verbatim text
with arguments. The library is pretty fast, but slower on integer formatting
than ``fmt::format_to`` with format string compilation on Karma's own benchmark,
see `Converting a hundred million integers to strings per second
<http://www.zverovich.net/2020/06/13/fast-int-to-string-revisited.html>`_.
