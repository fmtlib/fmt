9.0.0 - 2022-07-04
------------------

* Switched to the internal floating point formatter for all decimal presentation
  formats. In particular this results in consistent rounding on all platforms
  and removing the ``s[n]printf`` fallback for decimal FP formatting.

* Compile-time floating point formatting no longer requires the header-only
  mode. For example (`godbolt <https://godbolt.org/z/G37PTeG3b>`__):

  .. code:: c++

     #include <array>
     #include <fmt/compile.h>

     consteval auto compile_time_dtoa(double value) -> std::array<char, 10> {
       auto result = std::array<char, 10>();
       fmt::format_to(result.data(), FMT_COMPILE("{}"), value);
       return result;
     }

     constexpr auto answer = compile_time_dtoa(0.42);

  works with the default settings.

* Improved the implementation of
  `Dragonbox <https://github.com/jk-jeon/dragonbox>`_, the algorithm used for
  the default floating-point formatting
  (`#2713 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2713>`_,
  `#2750 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2750>`_).
  Thanks `@jk-jeon (Junekey Jeon) <https://github.com/jk-jeon>`_.

* Made ``fmt::to_string`` work with ``__float128``. This uses the internal
  FP formatter and works even on system without ``__float128`` support in
  ``[s]printf``.

* Disabled automatic ``std::ostream`` insertion operator (``operator<<``)
  discovery when ``fmt/ostream.h`` is included to prevent ODR violations.
  You can get the old behavior by defining ``FMT_DEPRECATED_OSTREAM`` but this
  will be removed in the next major release. Use ``fmt::streamed`` or
  ``fmt::ostream_formatter`` to enable formatting via ``std::ostream`` instead.
  
* Added ``fmt::ostream_formatter`` that can be used to write ``formatter``
  specializations that perform formatting via ``std::ostream``.
  For example (`godbolt <https://godbolt.org/z/5sEc5qMsf>`__):

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/ostream.h>

     struct date {
       int year, month, day;

       friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, const date& d) {
         return os << d.year << '-' << d.month << '-' << d.day;
       }
     };

     template <> struct fmt::formatter<date> : ostream_formatter {};

     std::string s = fmt::format("The date is {}", date{2012, 12, 9});
     // s == "The date is 2012-12-9"

* Added the ``fmt::streamed`` function that takes an object and formats it
  via ``std::ostream``.
  For example (`godbolt <https://godbolt.org/z/5G3346G1f>`__):

  .. code:: c++

     #include <thread>
     #include <fmt/ostream.h>

     int main() {
       fmt::print("Current thread id: {}\n",
                  fmt::streamed(std::this_thread::get_id()));
     }

  Note that ``fmt/std.h`` provides a ``formatter`` specialization for
  ``std::thread::id`` so you don't need to format it via ``std::ostream``.

* Deprecated implicit conversions of unscoped enums to integers for consistency
  with scoped enums.

* Added an argument-dependent lookup based ``format_as`` extension API to
  simplify formatting of enums.

* Added experimental ``std::variant`` formatting support
  (`#2941 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2941>`_).
  For example (`godbolt <https://godbolt.org/z/KG9z6cq68>`__):

  .. code:: c++

     #include <variant>
     #include <fmt/std.h>

     int main() {
       auto v = std::variant<int, std::string>(42);
       fmt::print("{}\n", v);
     }

  prints::

     variant(42)

  Thanks `@jehelset <https://github.com/jehelset>`_.

* Added experimental ``std::filesystem::path`` formatting support
  (`#2865 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2865>`_,
  `#2902 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2902>`_,
  `#2917 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2917>`_,
  `#2918 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2918>`_).
  For example (`godbolt <https://godbolt.org/z/o44dMexEb>`__):

  .. code:: c++

     #include <filesystem>
     #include <fmt/std.h>

     int main() {
       fmt::print("There is no place like {}.", std::filesystem::path("/home"));
     }

  prints::

     There is no place like "/home".

  Thanks `@phprus (Vladislav Shchapov) <https://github.com/phprus>`_.

* Added a ``std::thread::id`` formatter to ``fmt/std.h``.
  For example (`godbolt <https://godbolt.org/z/j1azbYf3E>`__):

  .. code:: c++

     #include <thread>
     #include <fmt/std.h>

     int main() {
       fmt::print("Current thread id: {}\n", std::this_thread::get_id());
     }

* Added ``fmt::styled`` that applies a text style to an individual argument
  (`#2793 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2793>`_).
  For example (`godbolt <https://godbolt.org/z/vWGW7v5M6>`__):

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/chrono.h>
     #include <fmt/color.h>

     int main() {
       auto now = std::chrono::system_clock::now();
       fmt::print(
         "[{}] {}: {}\n",
         fmt::styled(now, fmt::emphasis::bold),
         fmt::styled("error", fg(fmt::color::red)),
         "something went wrong");
     }

  prints

  Thanks `@rbrugo (Riccardo Brugo) <https://github.com/rbrugo>`_.

* Made ``fmt::print`` overload for text styles correctly handle UTF-8
  (`#2681 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2681>`_,
  `#2701 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2701>`_).
  Thanks `@AlexGuteniev (Alex Guteniev) <https://github.com/AlexGuteniev>`_.

* Fixed Unicode handling when writing to an ostream.

* Added support for nested specifiers to range formatting
  (`#2673 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2673>`_).
  For example (`godbolt <https://godbolt.org/z/xd3Gj38cf>`__):

  .. code:: c++

     #include <vector>
     #include <fmt/ranges.h>

     int main() {
       fmt::print("{::#x}\n", std::vector{10, 20, 30});
     }

  prints ``[0xa, 0x14, 0x1e]``.

  Thanks `@BRevzin (Barry Revzin) <https://github.com/BRevzin>`_.

* Implemented escaping of wide strings in ranges
  (`#2904 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2904>`_).
  Thanks `@phprus (Vladislav Shchapov) <https://github.com/phprus>`_.

* Added support for ranges with ``begin`` / ``end`` found via the
  argument-dependent lookup
  (`#2807 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2807>`_).
  Thanks `@rbrugo (Riccardo Brugo) <https://github.com/rbrugo>`_.

* Fixed formatting of certain kinds of ranges of ranges

  Thanks `@phprus (Vladislav Shchapov) <https://github.com/phprus>`_.

* Made compile-time checks work with named arguments of custom types and
  ``std::ostream`` ``print`` overloads
  (`#2816 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2816>`_,
  `#2817 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2817>`_,
  `#2819 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2819>`_).
  Thanks `@timsong-cpp <https://github.com/timsong-cpp>`_.

* Removed ``make_args_checked`` because it is no longer needed for compile-time
  checks (`#2760 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2760>`_).
  Thanks `@phprus (Vladislav Shchapov) <https://github.com/phprus>`_.

* Removed the following deprecated APIs: ``_format``, ``arg_join``,
  the ``format_to`` overload that takes a memory buffer,
  ``[v]fprintf`` that takes an ``ostream``.

* Removed the deprecated implicit conversion of ``[const] signed char*`` and 
  ``[const] unsigned char*`` to C strings.

* Removed the deprecated ``fmt/locale.h``.

* Replaced the deprecated ``fileno()`` with ``descriptor()`` in
  ``buffered_file``.

* Moved ``to_string_view`` to the ``detail`` namespace since it's an
  implementation detail.

* Made access mode of a created file consistent with ``fopen`` by setting
  ``S_IWGRP`` and ``S_IWOTH``
  (`#2733 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2733>`_).

     }

  prints "01.234".

  Thanks `@matrackif <https://github.com/matrackif>`_.

* Fixed handling of precision 0 when formatting chrono durations
  (`#2587 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2587>`_,
  `#2588 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2588>`_).
  Thanks `@lukester1975 <https://github.com/lukester1975>`_.

* Fixed an overflow on invalid inputs in the ``tm`` formatter
  (`#2564 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2564>`_).
  Thanks `@phprus (Vladislav Shchapov) <https://github.com/phprus>`_.

* Added ``fmt::group_digits`` that formats integers with a non-localized digit
  separator (comma) for groups of three digits.
  For example (`godbolt <https://godbolt.org/z/TxGxG9Poq>`__):

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/format.h>

     int main() {
       fmt::print("{} dollars", fmt::group_digits(1000000));
     }

  prints "1,000,000 dollars".

* Added support for faint, conceal, reverse and blink text styles
  (`#2394 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2394>`_):

  https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/576385/147710227-c68f5317-f8fa-42c3-9123-7c4ba3c398cb.mp4

  Thanks `@benit8 (BenoÃ®t Lormeau) <https://github.com/benit8>`_ and
  `@data-man (Dmitry Atamanov) <https://github.com/data-man>`_.

* Added experimental support for compile-time floating point formatting
  (`#2426 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2426>`_,
  `#2470 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2470>`_).
  It is currently limited to the header-only mode.
  Thanks `@alexezeder (Alexey Ochapov) <https://github.com/alexezeder>`_.

* Added UDL-based named argument support to compile-time format string checks
  (`#2640 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2640>`_,
  `#2649 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2649>`_).
  For example (`godbolt <https://godbolt.org/z/ohGbbvonv>`__):

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/format.h>

     int main() {
       using namespace fmt::literals;
       fmt::print("{answer:s}", "answer"_a=42);
     }

  gives a compile-time error on compilers with C++20 ``consteval`` and non-type
  template parameter support (gcc 10+) because ``s`` is not a valid format
  specifier for an integer.

  Thanks `@alexezeder (Alexey Ochapov) <https://github.com/alexezeder>`_.

* Implemented escaping of string range elements.
  For example (`godbolt <https://godbolt.org/z/rKvM1vKf3>`__):

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/ranges.h>
     #include <vector>

     int main() {
       fmt::print("{}", std::vector<std::string>{"\naan"});
     }

  is now printed as::

    ["\naan"]

  instead of::
  
    ["
    aan"]

* Added an experimental ``?`` specifier for escaping strings.
  (`#2674 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2674>`_).
  Thanks `@BRevzin (Barry Revzin) <https://github.com/BRevzin>`_.

* Switched to JSON-like representation of maps and sets for consistency with
  Python's ``str.format``.
  For example (`godbolt <https://godbolt.org/z/seKjoY9W5>`__):

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/ranges.h>
     #include <map>

     int main() {
       fmt::print("{}", std::map<std::string, int>{{"answer", 42}});
     }

  is now printed as::

    {"answer": 42}

* Extended ``fmt::join`` to support C++20-only ranges
  (`#2549 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2549>`_).
  Thanks `@BRevzin (Barry Revzin) <https://github.com/BRevzin>`_.

* Optimized handling of non-const-iterable ranges and implemented initial
  support for non-const-formattable types.

* Disabled implicit conversions of scoped enums to integers that was
  accidentally introduced in earlier versions
  (`#1841 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1841>`_).

* Deprecated implicit conversion of ``[const] signed char*`` and 
  ``[const] unsigned char*`` to C strings.

* Deprecated ``_format``, a legacy UDL-based format API
  (`#2646 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2646>`_).
  Thanks `@alexezeder (Alexey Ochapov) <https://github.com/alexezeder>`_.

* Marked ``format``, ``formatted_size`` and ``to_string`` as ``[[nodiscard]]``
  (`#2612 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2612>`_).
  `@0x8000-0000 (Florin Iucha) <https://github.com/0x8000-0000>`_.

* Added missing diagnostic when trying to format function and member pointers
  as well as objects convertible to pointers which is explicitly disallowed

  compilation (`#2565 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2565>`_).

* Changed the default access mode of files created by ``fmt::output_file`` to
  ``-rw-r--r--`` for consistency with ``fopen``
  (`#2530 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2530>`_).

* Make ``fmt::ostream::flush`` public
  (`#2435 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2435>`_).

8.0.0 - 2021-06-21
------------------

* Enabled compile-time format string checks by default.
  For example (`godbolt <https://godbolt.org/z/sMxcohGjz>`__):

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/core.h>

     int main() {
       fmt::print("{:d}", "I am not a number");
     }

  gives a compile-time error on compilers with C++20 ``consteval`` support
  (gcc 10+, clang 11+) because ``d`` is not a valid format specifier for a
  string.

  To pass a runtime string wrap it in ``fmt::runtime``:

  .. code:: c++

     fmt::print(fmt::runtime("{:d}"), "I am not a number");

* Added compile-time formatting
  (`#2019 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2019>`_,
  `#2044 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2044>`_,
  `#2056 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2056>`_,
  `#2072 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2072>`_,
  `#2075 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2075>`_,
  `#2078 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2078>`_,
  `#2129 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2129>`_,
  `#2326 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2326>`_).
  For example (`godbolt <https://godbolt.org/z/Mxx9d89jM>`__):

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/compile.h>

     consteval auto compile_time_itoa(int value) -> std::array<char, 10> {
       auto result = std::array<char, 10>();
       fmt::format_to(result.data(), FMT_COMPILE("{}"), value);
       return result;
     }

     constexpr auto answer = compile_time_itoa(42);

  Most of the formatting functionality is available at compile time with a
  notable exception of floating-point numbers and pointers.
  Thanks `@alexezeder (Alexey Ochapov) <https://github.com/alexezeder>`_.

* Optimized handling of format specifiers during format string compilation.
  For example, hexadecimal formatting (``"{:x}"``) is now 3-7x faster than
  before when using ``format_to`` with format string compilation and a
  stack-allocated buffer (`#1944 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1944>`_).

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In other cases, especially involving ``std::string`` construction, the
  speed up is usually lower because handling format specifiers takes a smaller
  fraction of the total time.

* Added the ``_cf`` user-defined literal to represent a compiled format string.
  It can be used instead of the ``FMT_COMPILE`` macro
  (`#2043 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2043>`_,
  `#2242 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2242>`_):

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/compile.h>

     using namespace fmt::literals;
     auto s = fmt::format(FMT_COMPILE("{}"), 42); // ð not modern
     auto s = fmt::format("{}"_cf, 42);           // ð modern as hell

  It requires compiler support for class types in non-type template parameters
  (a C++20 feature) which is available in GCC 9.3+.
  Thanks `@alexezeder (Alexey Ochapov) <https://github.com/alexezeder>`_.

* Format string compilation now requires ``format`` functions of ``formatter``
  specializations for user-defined types to be ``const``:

  .. code:: c++

     template <> struct fmt::formatter<my_type>: formatter<string_view> {
       template <typename FormatContext>
       auto format(my_type obj, FormatContext& ctx) const {  // Note const here.
         // ...
       }
     };

* Added UDL-based named argument support to format string compilation
  (`#2243 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2243>`_,
  `#2281 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2281>`_). For example:

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/compile.h>

     using namespace fmt::literals;
     auto s = fmt::format(FMT_COMPILE("{answer}"), "answer"_a = 42);

  Here the argument named "answer" is resolved at compile time with no
  runtime overhead.
  Thanks `@alexezeder (Alexey Ochapov) <https://github.com/alexezeder>`_.

* Added format string compilation support to ``fmt::print``
  (`#2280 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2280>`_,
  `#2304 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2304>`_).
  Thanks `@alexezeder (Alexey Ochapov) <https://github.com/alexezeder>`_.

* Added initial support for compiling {fmt} as a C++20 module
  (`#2235 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2235>`_,
  `#2240 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2240>`_,
  `#2260 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2260>`_,
  `#2282 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2282>`_,

  `#2306 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2306>`_,
  `#2307 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2307>`_,
  `#2309 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2309>`_,
  `#2318 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2318>`_,
  `#2324 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2324>`_,
  `#2332 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2332>`_,
  `#2340 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2340>`_).
  Thanks `@DanielaE (Daniela Engert) <https://github.com/DanielaE>`_.

* Made symbols private by default reducing shared library size
  (`#2301 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2301>`_). For example there was
  a ~15% reported reduction on one platform.
  Thanks `@sergiud (Sergiu Deitsch) <https://github.com/sergiud>`_.

* Optimized includes making the result of preprocessing ``fmt/format.h``
  ~20% smaller with libstdc++/C++20 and slightly improving build times
  (`#1998 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1998>`_).

* Added support of ranges with non-const ``begin`` / ``end``
  (`#1953 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1953>`_).
  Thanks `@kitegi (sarah) <https://github.com/kitegi>`_.

* Added support of ``std::byte`` and other formattable types to ``fmt::join``
  (`#1981 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1981>`_,
  `#2040 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2040>`_,
  `#2050 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2050>`_,
  `#2262 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2262>`_). For example:

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/format.h>
     #include <cstddef>
     #include <vector>

     int main() {
       auto bytes = std::vector{std::byte(4), std::byte(2)};
       fmt::print("{}", fmt::join(bytes, ""));
     }

  prints "42".

  Thanks `@kamibo (Camille Bordignon) <https://github.com/kamibo>`_.

* Implemented the default format for ``std::chrono::system_clock``
  (`#2319 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2319>`_,
  `#2345 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2345>`_). For example:

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/chrono.h>

     int main() {
       fmt::print("{}", std::chrono::system_clock::now());
     }

  prints "2021-06-18 15:22:00" (the output depends on the current date and
  time). Thanks `@sunmy2019 <https://github.com/sunmy2019>`_.

* Made more chrono specifiers locale independent by default. Use the ``'L'``
  specifier to get localized formatting. For example:

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/chrono.h>

     int main() {
       std::locale::global(std::locale("ru_RU.UTF-8"));
       auto monday = std::chrono::weekday(1);
       fmt::print("{}\n", monday);   // prints "Mon"
       fmt::print("{:L}\n", monday); // prints "Ð¿Ð½"
     }

* Improved locale handling in chrono formatting
  (`#2337 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2337>`_,
  `#2349 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2349>`_,
  `#2350 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2350>`_).
  Thanks `@phprus (Vladislav Shchapov) <https://github.com/phprus>`_.

* Deprecated ``fmt/locale.h`` moving the formatting functions that take a
  locale to ``fmt/format.h`` (``char``) and ``fmt/xchar`` (other overloads).
  This doesn't introduce a dependency on ``<locale>`` so there is virtually no
  compile time effect.

* Deprecated an undocumented ``format_to`` overload that takes
  ``basic_memory_buffer``.

* Made parameter order in ``vformat_to`` consistent with ``format_to``
  (`#2327 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2327>`_).

* Added support for time points with arbitrary durations
  (`#2208 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2208>`_). For example:

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/chrono.h>

     int main() {
       using tp = std::chrono::time_point<
         std::chrono::system_clock, std::chrono::seconds>;
       fmt::print("{:%S}", tp(std::chrono::seconds(42)));
     }

  prints "42".

* Formatting floating-point numbers no longer produces trailing zeros by default
  for consistency with ``std::format``. For example:

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/core.h>

     int main() {
       fmt::print("{0:.3}", 1.1);
     }

  prints "1.1". Use the ``'#'`` specifier to keep trailing zeros.

* Dropped a limit on the number of elements in a range and replaced ``{}`` with
  ``[]`` as range delimiters for consistency with Python's ``str.format``.

* The ``'L'`` specifier for locale-specific numeric formatting can now be
  combined with presentation specifiers as in ``std::format``. For example:

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/core.h>
     #include <locale>

     int main() {
       std::locale::global(std::locale("fr_FR.UTF-8"));
       fmt::print("{0:.2Lf}", 0.42);
     }

  prints "0,42". The deprecated ``'n'`` specifier has been removed.

* Made the ``0`` specifier ignored for infinity and NaN
  (`#2305 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2305>`_,
  `#2310 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2310>`_).
  Thanks `@Liedtke (Matthias Liedtke) <https://github.com/Liedtke>`_.

* Made the hexfloat formatting use the right alignment by default
  (`#2308 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2308>`_,
  `#2317 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2317>`_).
  Thanks `@Liedtke (Matthias Liedtke) <https://github.com/Liedtke>`_.

* Removed the deprecated numeric alignment (``'='``). Use the ``'0'`` specifier
  instead.

* Removed the deprecated ``fmt/posix.h`` header that has been replaced with
  ``fmt/os.h``.

* Removed the deprecated ``format_to_n_context``, ``format_to_n_args`` and
  ``make_format_to_n_args``. They have been replaced with ``format_context``,
  ``format_args` and ``make_format_args`` respectively.

* Moved ``wchar_t``-specific functions and types to ``fmt/xchar.h``.
  You can define ``FMT_DEPRECATED_INCLUDE_XCHAR`` to automatically include
  ``fmt/xchar.h`` from ``fmt/format.h`` but this will be disabled in the next
  major release.

* Fixed handling of the ``'+'`` specifier in localized formatting
  (`#2133 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2133>`_).

* Added support for the ``'s'`` format specifier that gives textual
  representation of ``bool``
  (`#2094 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2094>`_,
  `#2109 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2109>`_). For example:

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/core.h>

     int main() {
       fmt::print("{:s}", true);
     }

  prints "true".
  Thanks `@powercoderlol (Ivan Polyakov) <https://github.com/powercoderlol>`_.

* Made ``fmt::ptr`` work with function pointers
  (`#2131 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2131>`_). For example:

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/format.h>

     int main() {
       fmt::print("My main: {}\n", fmt::ptr(main));
     }

  Thanks `@mikecrowe (Mike Crowe) <https://github.com/mikecrowe>`_.

* The undocumented support for specializing ``formatter`` for pointer types
  has been removed.

* Fixed ``fmt::formatted_size`` with format string compilation
  (`#2141 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2141>`_,
  `#2161 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2161>`_).
  Thanks `@alexezeder (Alexey Ochapov) <https://github.com/alexezeder>`_.

* Fixed handling of empty format strings during format string compilation
  (`#2042 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2042>`_):

  .. code:: c++

     auto s = fmt::format(FMT_COMPILE(""));

  Thanks `@alexezeder (Alexey Ochapov) <https://github.com/alexezeder>`_.

* Fixed handling of enums in ``fmt::to_string``
  (`#2036 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2036>`_).

* Improved width computation
  (`#2033 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2033>`_,
  `#2091 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2091>`_). For example:

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/core.h>

     int main() {
       fmt::print("{:-<10}{}\n", "ä½ å¥½", "ä¸ç");
       fmt::print("{:-<10}{}\n", "hello", "world");
     }

  prints

  .. image:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/576385/
             119840373-cea3ca80-beb9-11eb-91e0-54266c48e181.png

  on a modern terminal.

* The experimental fast output stream (``fmt::ostream``) is now truncated by
  default for consistency with ``fopen``
  (`#2018 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2018>`_). For example:

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/os.h>

     int main() {
       fmt::ostream out1 = fmt::output_file("guide");
       out1.print("Zaphod");
       out1.close();
       fmt::ostream out2 = fmt::output_file("guide");
       out2.print("Ford");
     }

  writes "Ford" to the file "guide". To preserve the old file content if any
  pass ``fmt::file::WRONLY | fmt::file::CREATE`` flags to ``fmt::output_file``.

* Fixed moving of ``fmt::ostream`` that holds buffered data
  (`#2197 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2197>`_,
  `#2198 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2198>`_).
  Thanks `@vtta <https://github.com/vtta>`_.

* Replaced the ``fmt::system_error`` exception with a function of the same
  name that constructs ``std::system_error``
  (`#2266 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2266>`_).

* Replaced the ``fmt::windows_error`` exception with a function of the same
  name that constructs ``std::system_error`` with the category returned by
  ``fmt::system_category()``
  (`#2274 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2274>`_,
  `#2275 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2275>`_).
  The latter is similar to ``std::sytem_category`` but correctly handles UTF-8.
  Thanks `@phprus (Vladislav Shchapov) <https://github.com/phprus>`_.

* Replaced ``fmt::error_code`` with ``std::error_code`` and made it formattable
  (`#2269 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2269>`_,
  `#2270 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2270>`_,
  `#2273 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2273>`_).
  Thanks `@phprus (Vladislav Shchapov) <https://github.com/phprus>`_.
 
* Added speech synthesis support
  (`#2206 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2206>`_).

* Made ``format_to`` work with a memory buffer that has a custom allocator
  (`#2300 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2300>`_).
  Thanks `@voxmea <https://github.com/voxmea>`_.

* Added ``Allocator::max_size`` support to ``basic_memory_buffer``.
  (`#1960 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1960>`_).
  Thanks `@phprus (Vladislav Shchapov) <https://github.com/phprus>`_.

* Added wide string support to ``fmt::join``
  (`#2236 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2236>`_).
  Thanks `@crbrz <https://github.com/crbrz>`_.

* Made iterators passed to ``formatter`` specializations via a format context
  satisfy C++20 ``std::output_iterator`` requirements
  (`#2156 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2156>`_,
  `#2158 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2158>`_,
  `#2195 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2195>`_,
  `#2204 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2204>`_).
  Thanks `@randomnetcat (Jason Cobb) <https://github.com/randomnetcat>`_.

* Optimized the ``printf`` implementation
  (`#1982 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1982>`_,
  `#1984 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1984>`_,
  `#2016 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2016>`_,
  `#2164 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2164>`_).
  Thanks `@rimathia <https://github.com/rimathia>`_ and
  `@moiwi <https://github.com/moiwi>`_.

* Improved detection of ``constexpr`` ``char_traits``
  (`#2246 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2246>`_,
  `#2257 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2257>`_).
  Thanks `@phprus (Vladislav Shchapov) <https://github.com/phprus>`_.

* Fixed writing to ``stdout`` when it is redirected to ``NUL`` on Windows
  (`#2080 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2080>`_).

* Fixed exception propagation from iterators
  (`#2097 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2097>`_).
  
* Improved ``strftime`` error handling 
  (`#2238 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2238>`_,
  `#2244 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2244>`_).
  Thanks `@yumeyao <https://github.com/yumeyao>`_.

* Stopped using deprecated GCC UDL template extension.

* Added ``fmt/args.h`` to the install target
  (`#2096 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2096>`_).

* Error messages are now passed to assert when exceptions are disabled
  (`#2145 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2145>`_).
  Thanks `@NobodyXu (Jiahao XU) <https://github.com/NobodyXu>`_.

* Added the ``FMT_MASTER_PROJECT`` CMake option to control build and install
  targets when {fmt} is included via ``add_subdirectory``
  (`#2098 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2098>`_,
  `#2100 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2100>`_).
  Thanks `@randomizedthinking <https://github.com/randomizedthinking>`_.

* Improved build configuration
  (`#2026 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2026>`_,
  `#2122 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/2122>`_).
  Thanks `@luncliff (Park DongHa) <https://github.com/luncliff>`_ and
  `@ibaned (Dan Ibanez) <https://github.com/ibaned>`_.

* Fixed various warnings and compilation issues

7.1.3 - 2020-11-24
------------------

* Fixed handling of buffer boundaries in ``format_to_n``
  (`#1996 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1996>`_,
  `#2029 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2029>`_).

* Fixed linkage errors when linking with a shared library
  (`#2011 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2011>`_).

* Reintroduced ostream support to range formatters
  (`#2014 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2014>`_).

* Worked around an issue with mixing std versions in gcc
  (`#2017 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2017>`_).

7.1.2 - 2020-11-04
------------------

* Fixed floating point formatting with large precision
  (`#1976 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1976>`_).

7.1.1 - 2020-11-01
------------------

* Fixed ABI compatibility with 7.0.x
  (`#1961 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1961>`_).

* Added the ``FMT_ARM_ABI_COMPATIBILITY`` macro to work around ABI
  incompatibility between GCC and Clang on ARM
  (`#1919 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1919>`_).

* Worked around a SFINAE bug in GCC 8
  (`#1957 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1957>`_).

* Fixed linkage errors when building with GCC's LTO
  (`#1955 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1955>`_).

* Fixed a compilation error when building without ``__builtin_clz`` or equivalent
  (`#1968 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1968>`_).
  Thanks `@tohammer (Tobias Hammer) <https://github.com/tohammer>`_.

* Fixed a sign conversion warning
  (`#1964 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1964>`_).
  Thanks `@OptoCloud <https://github.com/OptoCloud>`_.

7.1.0 - 2020-10-25
------------------

* Switched from `Grisu3
  <https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/florian-loitsch/printf.pdf>`_
  to `Dragonbox <https://github.com/jk-jeon/dragonbox>`_ for the default
  floating-point formatting which gives the shortest decimal representation
  with round-trip guarantee and correct rounding
  (`#1882 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1882>`_,
  `#1887 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1887>`_,
  `#1894 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1894>`_). This makes {fmt} up to
  20-30x faster than common implementations of ``std::ostringstream`` and
  ``sprintf`` on `dtoa-benchmark <https://github.com/fmtlib/dtoa-benchmark>`_
  and faster than double-conversion and RyÅ«:

  .. image:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/576385/
             95684665-11719600-0ba8-11eb-8e5b-972ff4e49428.png

  It is possible to get even better performance at the cost of larger binary
  size by compiling with the ``FMT_USE_FULL_CACHE_DRAGONBOX`` macro set to 1.

  Thanks `@jk-jeon (Junekey Jeon) <https://github.com/jk-jeon>`_.

* Added an experimental unsynchronized file output API which, together with
  `format string compilation <https://fmt.dev/latest/api.html#compile-api>`_,
  can give `5-9 times speed up compared to fprintf
  <https://www.zverovich.net/2020/08/04/optimal-file-buffer-size.html>`_
  on common platforms (`godbolt <https://godbolt.org/z/nsTcG8>`__):

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/os.h>

     int main() {
       auto f = fmt::output_file("guide");
       f.print("The answer is {}.", 42);
     }

* Added a formatter for ``std::chrono::time_point<system_clock>``
  (`#1819 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1819>`_,
  `#1837 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1837>`_). For example
  (`godbolt <https://godbolt.org/z/c4M6fh>`__):

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/chrono.h>

     int main() {
       auto now = std::chrono::system_clock::now();
       fmt::print("The time is {:%H:%M:%S}.\n", now);
     }

  Thanks `@adamburgess (Adam Burgess) <https://github.com/adamburgess>`_.

* Added support for ranges with non-const ``begin``/``end`` to ``fmt::join``
  (`#1784 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1784>`_,
  `#1786 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1786>`_). For example
  (`godbolt <https://godbolt.org/z/jP63Tv>`__):

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/ranges.h>
     #include <range/v3/view/filter.hpp>

     int main() {
       using std::literals::string_literals::operator""s;
       auto strs = std::array{"a"s, "bb"s, "ccc"s};
       auto range = strs | ranges::views::filter(
         [] (const std::string &x) { return x.size() != 2; }
       );
       fmt::print("{}\n", fmt::join(range, ""));
     }

  prints "accc".

  Thanks `@tonyelewis (Tony E Lewis) <https://github.com/tonyelewis>`_.

* Added a ``memory_buffer::append`` overload that takes a range
  (`#1806 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1806>`_).
  Thanks `@BRevzin (Barry Revzin) <https://github.com/BRevzin>`_.

* Improved handling of single code units in ``FMT_COMPILE``. For example:

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/compile.h>

     char* f(char* buf) {
       return fmt::format_to(buf, FMT_COMPILE("x{}"), 42);
     }

  compiles to just (`godbolt <https://godbolt.org/z/5vncz3>`__):

  .. code:: asm

     _Z1fPc:
       movb $120, (%rdi)
       xorl %edx, %edx
       cmpl $42, _ZN3fmt2v76detail10basic_dataIvE23zero_or_powers_of_10_32E+8(%rip)
       movl $3, %eax
       seta %dl
       subl %edx, %eax
       movzwl _ZN3fmt2v76detail10basic_dataIvE6digitsE+84(%rip), %edx
       cltq
       addq %rdi, %rax
       movw %dx, -2(%rax)
       ret

  Here a single ``mov`` instruction writes ``'x'`` (``$120``) to the output
  buffer.

* Added dynamic width support to format string compilation
  (`#1809 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1809>`_).

* Improved error reporting for unformattable types: now you'll get the type name
  directly in the error message instead of the note:

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/core.h>

     struct how_about_no {};

     int main() {
       fmt::print("{}", how_about_no());
     }

  Error (`godbolt <https://godbolt.org/z/GoxM4e>`__):

  ``fmt/core.h:1438:3: error: static_assert failed due to requirement
  'fmt::v7::formattable<how_about_no>()' "Cannot format an argument.
  To make type T formattable provide a formatter<T> specialization:
  https://fmt.dev/latest/api.html#udt"
  ...``

* Added the `make_args_checked <https://fmt.dev/7.1.0/api.html#argument-lists>`_
  function template that allows you to write formatting functions with
  compile-time format string checks and avoid binary code bloat
  (`godbolt <https://godbolt.org/z/PEf9qr>`__):

  .. code:: c++

     void vlog(const char* file, int line, fmt::string_view format,
               fmt::format_args args) {
       fmt::print("{}: {}: ", file, line);
       fmt::vprint(format, args);
     }

     template <typename S, typename... Args>
     void log(const char* file, int line, const S& format, Args&&... args) {
       vlog(file, line, format,
           fmt::make_args_checked<Args...>(format, args...));
     }

     #define MY_LOG(format, ...) \
       log(__FILE__, __LINE__, FMT_STRING(format), __VA_ARGS__)

     MY_LOG("invalid squishiness: {}", 42);

* Replaced ``snprintf`` fallback with a faster internal IEEE 754 ``float`` and
  ``double`` formatter for arbitrary precision. For example
  (`godbolt <https://godbolt.org/z/dPhWvj>`__):

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/core.h>

     int main() {
       fmt::print("{:.500}\n", 4.9406564584124654E-324);
     }

  prints

  ``4.9406564584124654417656879286822137236505980261432476442558568250067550727020875186529983636163599237979656469544571773092665671035593979639877479601078187812630071319031140452784581716784898210368871863605699873072305000638740915356498438731247339727316961514003171538539807412623856559117102665855668676818703956031062493194527159149245532930545654440112748012970999954193198940908041656332452475714786901472678015935523861155013480352649347201937902681071074917033322268447533357208324319360923829e-324``.

* Made ``format_to_n`` and ``formatted_size`` part of the `core API
  <https://fmt.dev/latest/api.html#core-api>`__
  (`godbolt <https://godbolt.org/z/sPjY1K>`__):

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/core.h>

     int main() {
       char buffer[10];
       auto result = fmt::format_to_n(buffer, sizeof(buffer), "{}", 42);
     }

* Added ``fmt::format_to_n`` overload with format string compilation
  (`#1764 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1764>`_,
  `#1767 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1767>`_,
  `#1869 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1869>`_). For example
  (`godbolt <https://godbolt.org/z/93h86q>`__):

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/compile.h>

     int main() {
       char buffer[8];
       fmt::format_to_n(buffer, sizeof(buffer), FMT_COMPILE("{}"), 42);
     }

  Thanks `@Kurkin (Dmitry Kurkin) <https://github.com/Kurkin>`_,
  `@alexezeder (Alexey Ochapov) <https://github.com/alexezeder>`_.

* Added ``fmt::format_to`` overload that take ``text_style``
  (`#1593 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1593>`_,
  `#1842 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1842>`_,
  `#1843 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1843>`_). For example
  (`godbolt <https://godbolt.org/z/91153r>`__):

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/color.h>

     int main() {
       std::string out;
       fmt::format_to(std::back_inserter(out),
                      fmt::emphasis::bold | fg(fmt::color::red),
                      "The answer is {}.", 42);
     }

  Thanks `@Naios (Denis Blank) <https://github.com/Naios>`_.

* Made the ``'#'`` specifier emit trailing zeros in addition to the decimal
  point (`#1797 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1797>`_). For example
  (`godbolt <https://godbolt.org/z/bhdcW9>`__):

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/core.h>

     int main() {
       fmt::print("{:#.2g}", 0.5);
     }

  prints ``0.50``.

* Changed the default floating point format to not include ``.0`` for
  consistency with ``std::format`` and ``std::to_chars``
  (`#1893 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1893>`_,
  `#1943 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1943>`_). It is possible to get
  the decimal point and trailing zero with the ``#`` specifier.

* Fixed an issue with floating-point formatting that could result in addition of
  a non-significant trailing zero in rare cases e.g. ``1.00e-34`` instead of
  ``1.0e-34`` (`#1873 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1873>`_,
  `#1917 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1917>`_).

* Made ``fmt::to_string`` fallback on ``ostream`` insertion operator if
  the ``formatter`` specialization is not provided
  (`#1815 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1815>`_,
  `#1829 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1829>`_).
  Thanks `@alexezeder (Alexey Ochapov) <https://github.com/alexezeder>`_.

* Added support for the append mode to the experimental file API and
  improved ``fcntl.h`` detection.
  (`#1847 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1847>`_,
  `#1848 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1848>`_).
  Thanks `@t-wiser <https://github.com/t-wiser>`_.

* Fixed handling of types that have both an implicit conversion operator and
  an overloaded ``ostream`` insertion operator
  (`#1766 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1766>`_).

* Fixed a slicing issue in an internal iterator type
  (`#1822 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1822>`_).
  Thanks `@BRevzin (Barry Revzin) <https://github.com/BRevzin>`_.

* Fixed an issue in locale-specific integer formatting
  (`#1927 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1927>`_).

* Fixed handling of exotic code unit types
  (`#1870 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1870>`_,
  `#1932 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1932>`_).

* Improved ``FMT_ALWAYS_INLINE``
  (`#1878 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1878>`_).
  Thanks `@jk-jeon (Junekey Jeon) <https://github.com/jk-jeon>`_.

* Removed dependency on ``windows.h``
  (`#1900 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1900>`_).

7.0.3 - 2020-08-06
------------------

* Worked around broken ``numeric_limits`` for 128-bit integers
  (`#1787 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1787>`_).

* Added error reporting on missing named arguments
  (`#1796 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1796>`_).

* Stopped using 128-bit integers with clang-cl
  (`#1800 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1800>`_).
  Thanks `@Kingcom <https://github.com/Kingcom>`_.

* Fixed issues in locale-specific integer formatting
  (`#1782 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1782>`_,
  `#1801 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1801>`_).

7.0.2 - 2020-07-29
------------------

* Worked around broken ``numeric_limits`` for 128-bit integers
  (`#1725 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1725>`_).

* Fixed compatibility with CMake 3.4
  (`#1779 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1779>`_).

* Fixed handling of digit separators in locale-specific formatting
  (`#1782 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1782>`_).

7.0.1 - 2020-07-07
------------------

* Updated the inline version namespace name.

* Worked around a gcc bug in mangling of alias templates
  (`#1753 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1753>`_).

* Fixed a linkage error on Windows
  (`#1757 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1757>`_).
  Thanks `@Kurkin (Dmitry Kurkin) <https://github.com/Kurkin>`_.

* Fixed minor issues with the documentation.

7.0.0 - 2020-07-05
------------------

* Reduced the library size. For example, on macOS a stripped test binary
  statically linked with {fmt} `shrank from ~368k to less than 100k
  <http://www.zverovich.net/2020/05/21/reducing-library-size.html>`_.

* Added a simpler and more efficient `format string compilation API
  <https://fmt.dev/7.0.0/api.html#compile-api>`_:

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/compile.h>

     // Converts 42 into std::string using the most efficient method and no
     // runtime format string processing.
     std::string s = fmt::format(FMT_COMPILE("{}"), 42);

  The old ``fmt::compile`` API is now deprecated.

* Optimized integer formatting: ``format_to`` with format string compilation
  and a stack-allocated buffer is now `faster than to_chars on both
  libc++ and libstdc++
  <http://www.zverovich.net/2020/06/13/fast-int-to-string-revisited.html>`_.

* Optimized handling of small format strings. For example,

  .. code:: c++

      fmt::format("Result: {}: ({},{},{},{})", str1, str2, str3, str4, str5)

  is now ~40% faster (`#1685 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1685>`_).

* Applied extern templates to improve compile times when using the core API
  and ``fmt/format.h`` (`#1452 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1452>`_).
  For example, on macOS with clang the compile time of a test translation unit
  dropped from 2.3s to 0.3s with ``-O2`` and from 0.6s to 0.3s with the default
  settings (``-O0``).

  Before (``-O2``)::

    % time c++ -c test.cc -I include -std=c++17 -O2
    c++ -c test.cc -I include -std=c++17 -O2  2.22s user 0.08s system 99% cpu 2.311 total

  After (``-O2``)::

    % time c++ -c test.cc -I include -std=c++17 -O2
    c++ -c test.cc -I include -std=c++17 -O2  0.26s user 0.04s system 98% cpu 0.303 total

  Before (default)::

    % time c++ -c test.cc -I include -std=c++17
    c++ -c test.cc -I include -std=c++17  0.53s user 0.06s system 98% cpu 0.601 total

  After (default)::

    % time c++ -c test.cc -I include -std=c++17
    c++ -c test.cc -I include -std=c++17  0.24s user 0.06s system 98% cpu 0.301 total

  It is still recommended to use ``fmt/core.h`` instead of ``fmt/format.h`` but
  the compile time difference is now smaller. Thanks
  `@alex3d <https://github.com/alex3d>`_ for the suggestion.

* Named arguments are now stored on stack (no dynamic memory allocations) and
  the compiled code is more compact and efficient. For example

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/core.h>

     int main() {
       fmt::print("The answer is {answer}\n", fmt::arg("answer", 42));
     }

  compiles to just (`godbolt <https://godbolt.org/z/NcfEp_>`__)

  .. code:: asm

      .LC0:
              .string "answer"
      .LC1:
              .string "The answer is {answer}\n"
      main:
              sub     rsp, 56
              mov     edi, OFFSET FLAT:.LC1
              mov     esi, 23
              movabs  rdx, 4611686018427387905
              lea     rax, [rsp+32]
              lea     rcx, [rsp+16]
              mov     QWORD PTR [rsp+8], 1
              mov     QWORD PTR [rsp], rax
              mov     DWORD PTR [rsp+16], 42
              mov     QWORD PTR [rsp+32], OFFSET FLAT:.LC0
              mov     DWORD PTR [rsp+40], 0
              call    fmt::v6::vprint(fmt::v6::basic_string_view<char>,
                                      fmt::v6::format_args)
              xor     eax, eax
              add     rsp, 56
              ret

          .L.str.1:
                  .asciz  "answer"

* Implemented compile-time checks for dynamic width and precision
  (`#1614 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1614>`_):

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/format.h>

     int main() {
       fmt::print(FMT_STRING("{0:{1}}"), 42);
     }

  now gives a compilation error because argument 1 doesn't exist::

    In file included from test.cc:1:
    include/fmt/format.h:2726:27: error: constexpr variable 'invalid_format' must be
    initialized by a constant expression
      FMT_CONSTEXPR_DECL bool invalid_format =
                              ^
    ...
    include/fmt/core.h:569:26: note: in call to
    '&checker(s, {}).context_->on_error(&"argument not found"[0])'
        if (id >= num_args_) on_error("argument not found");
                            ^

* Added sentinel support to ``fmt::join``
  (`#1689 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1689>`_)

  .. code:: c++

    struct zstring_sentinel {};
    bool operator==(const char* p, zstring_sentinel) { return *p == '\0'; }
    bool operator!=(const char* p, zstring_sentinel) { return *p != '\0'; }

    struct zstring {
      const char* p;
      const char* begin() const { return p; }
      zstring_sentinel end() const { return {}; }
    };

    auto s = fmt::format("{}", fmt::join(zstring{"hello"}, "_"));
    // s == "h_e_l_l_o"

  Thanks `@BRevzin (Barry Revzin) <https://github.com/BRevzin>`_.

* Added support for named arguments, ``clear`` and ``reserve`` to
  ``dynamic_format_arg_store``
  (`#1655 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1655>`_,
  `#1663 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1663>`_,
  `#1674 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1674>`_,
  `#1677 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1677>`_).
  Thanks `@vsolontsov-ll (Vladimir Solontsov)
  <https://github.com/vsolontsov-ll>`_.

* Added support for the ``'c'`` format specifier to integral types for
  compatibility with ``std::format``
  (`#1652 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1652>`_).

* Replaced the ``'n'`` format specifier with ``'L'`` for compatibility with
  ``std::format`` (`#1624 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1624>`_).
  The ``'n'`` specifier can be enabled via the ``FMT_DEPRECATED_N_SPECIFIER``
  macro.

* The ``'='`` format specifier is now disabled by default for compatibility with
  ``std::format``. It can be enabled via the ``FMT_DEPRECATED_NUMERIC_ALIGN``
  macro.

* Removed the following deprecated APIs:

  * ``FMT_STRING_ALIAS`` and ``fmt`` macros - replaced by ``FMT_STRING``
  * ``fmt::basic_string_view::char_type`` - replaced by
    ``fmt::basic_string_view::value_type``
  * ``convert_to_int``
  * ``format_arg_store::types``
  * ``*parse_context`` - replaced by ``*format_parse_context``
  * ``FMT_DEPRECATED_INCLUDE_OS``
  * ``FMT_DEPRECATED_PERCENT`` - incompatible with ``std::format``
  * ``*writer`` - replaced by compiled format API

* Renamed the ``internal`` namespace to ``detail``
  (`#1538 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1538>`_). The former is still
  provided as an alias if the ``FMT_USE_INTERNAL`` macro is defined.

* Improved compatibility between ``fmt::printf`` with the standard specs
  (`#1595 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1595>`_,
  `#1682 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1682>`_,
  `#1683 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1683>`_,
  `#1687 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1687>`_,
  `#1699 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1699>`_).
  Thanks `@rimathia <https://github.com/rimathia>`_.

* Fixed handling of ``operator<<`` overloads that use ``copyfmt``
  (`#1666 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1666>`_).

* Added the ``FMT_OS`` CMake option to control inclusion of OS-specific APIs
  in the fmt target. This can be useful for embedded platforms
  (`#1654 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1654>`_,
  `#1656 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1656>`_).
  Thanks `@kwesolowski (Krzysztof Wesolowski)
  <https://github.com/kwesolowski>`_.

* Replaced ``FUZZING_BUILD_MODE_UNSAFE_FOR_PRODUCTION`` with the ``FMT_FUZZ``
  macro to prevent interferring with fuzzing of projects using {fmt}
  (`#1650 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1650>`_).
  Thanks `@asraa (Asra Ali) <https://github.com/asraa>`_.

* Fixed compatibility with emscripten
  (`#1636 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1636>`_,
  `#1637 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1637>`_).

6.2.1 - 2020-05-09
------------------

* Fixed ostream support in ``sprintf``
  (`#1631 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1631>`_).

* Fixed type detection when using implicit conversion to ``string_view`` and
  ostream ``operator<<`` inconsistently
  (`#1662 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1662>`_).

6.2.0 - 2020-04-05
------------------

* Improved error reporting when trying to format an object of a non-formattable
  type:

  .. code:: c++

     fmt::format("{}", S());

  now gives::

    include/fmt/core.h:1015:5: error: static_assert failed due to requirement
    'formattable' "Cannot format argument. To make type T formattable provide a
    formatter<T> specialization:
    https://fmt.dev/latest/api.html#formatting-user-defined-types"
        static_assert(
        ^
    ...
    note: in instantiation of function template specialization
    'fmt::v6::format<char [3], S, char>' requested here
      fmt::format("{}", S());
           ^

  if ``S`` is not formattable.

* Reduced the library size by ~10%.

* Always print decimal point if ``#`` is specified
  (`#1476 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1476>`_,
  `#1498 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1498>`_):

  .. code:: c++

     fmt::print("{:#.0f}", 42.0);

  now prints ``42.``

* Implemented the ``'L'`` specifier for locale-specific numeric formatting to
  improve compatibility with ``std::format``. The ``'n'`` specifier is now
  deprecated and will be removed in the next major release.

* Moved OS-specific APIs such as ``windows_error`` from ``fmt/format.h`` to
  ``fmt/os.h``. You can define ``FMT_DEPRECATED_INCLUDE_OS`` to automatically
  include ``fmt/os.h`` from ``fmt/format.h`` for compatibility but this will be
  disabled in the next major release.

* Added precision overflow detection in floating-point formatting.

* Implemented detection of invalid use of ``fmt::arg``.

* Used ``type_identity`` to block unnecessary template argument deduction.
  Thanks Tim Song.

* Improved UTF-8 handling
  (`#1109 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1109>`_):

  .. code:: c++

     fmt::print("â{0:â^{2}}â\n"
                "â{1: ^{2}}â\n"
                "â{0:â^{2}}â\n", "", "ÐÑÐ¸Ð²ÐµÑ, Ð¼Ð¸Ñ!", 20);

  now prints::

     ââââââââââââââââââââââ
     â    ÐÑÐ¸Ð²ÐµÑ, Ð¼Ð¸Ñ!    â
     ââââââââââââââââââââââ

  on systems that support Unicode.

* Added experimental dynamic argument storage
  (`#1170 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1170>`_,
  `#1584 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1584>`_):

  .. code:: c++

     fmt::dynamic_format_arg_store<fmt::format_context> store;
     store.push_back("answer");
     store.push_back(42);
     fmt::vprint("The {} is {}.\n", store);
  
  prints::

     The answer is 42.

  <https://github.com/vsolontsov-ll>`_.

* Made ``fmt::join`` accept ``initializer_list``

* Fixed handling of output iterators in ``format_to_n``
  (`#1506 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1506>`_).

* Fixed formatting of ``std::chrono::duration`` types to wide output
  (`#1533 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1533>`_).
  Thanks `@zeffy (pilao) <https://github.com/zeffy>`_.

  (`#1553 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1553>`_).
  Thanks `@dominicpoeschko <https://github.com/dominicpoeschko>`_.

* Added the ability to disable floating-point formatting via ``FMT_USE_FLOAT``,
  ``FMT_USE_DOUBLE`` and ``FMT_USE_LONG_DOUBLE`` macros for extremely
  memory-constrained embedded system
  (`#1590 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1590>`_).
  Thanks `@albaguirre (Alberto Aguirre) <https://github.com/albaguirre>`_.

6.1.2 - 2019-12-11
------------------

* Fixed ABI compatibility with ``libfmt.so.6.0.0``
  (`#1471 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1471>`_).

* Fixed handling types convertible to ``std::string_view``
  (`#1451 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1451>`_).
  Thanks `@denizevrenci (Deniz Evrenci) <https://github.com/denizevrenci>`_.

* Made CUDA test an opt-in enabled via the ``FMT_CUDA_TEST`` CMake option.

* Fixed sign conversion warnings
  (`#1440 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1440>`_).
  Thanks `@0x8000-0000 (Florin Iucha) <https://github.com/0x8000-0000>`_.

6.1.1 - 2019-12-04
------------------

* Fixed shared library build on Windows
  (`#1443 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1443>`_,
  `#1445 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1445>`_,
  `#1446 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1446>`_,
  `#1450 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1450>`_).
  Thanks `@egorpugin (Egor Pugin) <https://github.com/egorpugin>`_,
  `@bbolli (Beat Bolli) <https://github.com/bbolli>`_.

* Added a missing decimal point in exponent notation with trailing zeros.

* Removed deprecated ``format_arg_store::TYPES``.

6.1.0 - 2019-12-01
------------------

* {fmt} now formats IEEE 754 ``float`` and ``double`` using the shortest decimal
  representation with correct rounding by default:

  .. code:: c++

     #include <cmath>
     #include <fmt/core.h>

     int main() {
       fmt::print("{}", M_PI);
     }

  prints ``3.141592653589793``.

* Made the fast binary to decimal floating-point formatter the default,
  simplified it and improved performance. {fmt} is now 15 times faster than
  libc++'s ``std::ostringstream``, 11 times faster than ``printf`` and 10%
  faster than double-conversion on `dtoa-benchmark
  <https://github.com/fmtlib/dtoa-benchmark>`_:

* {fmt} no longer converts ``float`` arguments to ``double``. In particular this
  improves the default (shortest) representation of floats and makes
  ``fmt::format`` consistent with ``std::format`` specs
  (`#1336 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1336>`_,
  `#1353 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1353>`_,
  `#1360 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1360>`_,
  `#1361 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1361>`_):

  .. code:: c++

     fmt::print("{}", 0.1f);

  prints ``0.1`` instead of ``0.10000000149011612``.

  Thanks `@orivej (Orivej Desh) <https://github.com/orivej>`_.

* Made floating-point formatting output consistent with ``printf``/iostreams
  (`#1376 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1376>`_,
  `#1417 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1417>`_).

* Added support for 128-bit integers
  (`#1287 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1287>`_):

  .. code:: c++

     fmt::print("{}", std::numeric_limits<__int128_t>::max());

  prints ``170141183460469231731687303715884105727``.

  Thanks `@denizevrenci (Deniz Evrenci) <https://github.com/denizevrenci>`_.

* The overload of ``print`` that takes ``text_style`` is now atomic, i.e. the
  output from different threads doesn't interleave
  (`#1351 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1351>`_).
  Thanks `@tankiJong (Tanki Zhang) <https://github.com/tankiJong>`_.

* Made compile time in the header-only mode ~20% faster by reducing the number
  of template instantiations. ``wchar_t`` overload of ``vprint`` was moved from
  ``fmt/core.h`` to ``fmt/format.h``.

* Added an overload of ``fmt::join`` that works with tuples
  (`#1322 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1322>`_,
  `#1330 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1330>`_):

  .. code:: c++

     #include <tuple>
     #include <fmt/ranges.h>

     int main() {
       std::tuple<char, int, float> t{'a', 1, 2.0f};
       fmt::print("{}", t);
     }

  prints ``('a', 1, 2.0)``.

  Thanks `@jeremyong (Jeremy Ong) <https://github.com/jeremyong>`_.

* Changed formatting of octal zero with prefix from "00" to "0":

  .. code:: c++

     fmt::print("{:#o}", 0);

  prints ``0``.

* The locale is now passed to ostream insertion (``<<``) operators
  (`#1406 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1406>`_):

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/locale.h>
     #include <fmt/ostream.h>

     struct S {
       double value;
     };

     std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, S s) {
       return os << s.value;
     }

     int main() {
       auto s = fmt::format(std::locale("fr_FR.UTF-8"), "{}", S{0.42});
       // s == "0,42"
     }

  Thanks `@dlaugt (Daniel LaÃ¼gt) <https://github.com/dlaugt>`_.

* Locale-specific number formatting now uses grouping
  (`#1393 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1393>`_
  `#1394 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1394>`_).
  Thanks `@skrdaniel <https://github.com/skrdaniel>`_.

* Fixed handling of types with deleted implicit rvalue conversion to
  ``const char**`` (`#1421 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1421>`_):

  .. code:: c++

     struct mystring {
       operator const char*() const&;
       operator const char*() &;
       operator const char*() const&& = delete;
       operator const char*() && = delete;
     };
     mystring str;
     fmt::print("{}", str); // now compiles

* Enums are now mapped to correct underlying types instead of ``int``
  (`#1286 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1286>`_).
  Thanks `@agmt (Egor Seredin) <https://github.com/agmt>`_.

* Enum classes are no longer implicitly converted to ``int``
  (`#1424 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1424>`_).

* Added ``basic_format_parse_context`` for consistency with C++20
  ``std::format`` and deprecated ``basic_parse_context``.

* Fixed handling of UTF-8 in precision
  (`#1389 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1389>`_,
  `#1390 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1390>`_).
  Thanks `@tajtiattila (Attila Tajti) <https://github.com/tajtiattila>`_.

* {fmt} can now be installed on Linux, macOS and Windows with
  `Conda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/>`__ using its
  `conda-forge <https://conda-forge.org>`__
  `package <https://github.com/conda-forge/fmt-feedstock>`__
  (`#1410 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1410>`_)::

    conda install -c conda-forge fmt

  Thanks `@tdegeus (Tom de Geus) <https://github.com/tdegeus>`_.

6.0.0 - 2019-08-26
------------------

* Switched to the `MIT license
  <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/blob/5a4b24613ba16cc689977c3b5bd8274a3ba1dd1f/LICENSE.rst>`_
  with an optional exception that allows distributing binary code without
  attribution.

* Floating-point formatting is now locale-independent by default:

  .. code:: c++

     #include <locale>
     #include <fmt/core.h>

     int main() {
       std::locale::global(std::locale("ru_RU.UTF-8"));
       fmt::print("value = {}", 4.2);
     }

  prints "value = 4.2" regardless of the locale.

  For locale-specific formatting use the ``n`` specifier:

  .. code:: c++

     std::locale::global(std::locale("ru_RU.UTF-8"));
     fmt::print("value = {:n}", 4.2);

  prints "value = 4,2".

* Added an experimental Grisu floating-point formatting algorithm
  implementation (disabled by default). To enable it compile with the
  ``FMT_USE_GRISU`` macro defined to 1:

  .. code:: c++

     #define FMT_USE_GRISU 1
     #include <fmt/format.h>

     auto s = fmt::format("{}", 4.2); // formats 4.2 using Grisu

  With Grisu enabled, {fmt} is 13x faster than ``std::ostringstream`` (libc++)
  and 10x faster than ``sprintf`` on `dtoa-benchmark
  <https://github.com/fmtlib/dtoa-benchmark>`_ (`full results
  <https://fmt.dev/unknown_mac64_clang10.0.html>`_):

  .. image:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/576385/
             54883977-9fe8c000-4e28-11e9-8bde-272d122e7c52.jpg

* Separated formatting and parsing contexts for consistency with
  `C++20 std::format <http://eel.is/c++draft/format>`_, removing the
  undocumented ``basic_format_context::parse_context()`` function.

* Added `oss-fuzz <https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz>`_ support
  (`#1199 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1199>`_).
  Thanks `@pauldreik (Paul Dreik) <https://github.com/pauldreik>`_.

* ``formatter`` specializations now always take precedence over ``operator<<``
  (`#952 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/952>`_):

  .. code:: c++

     #include <iostream>
     #include <fmt/ostream.h>

     struct S {};

     std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, S) {
       return os << 1;
     }

     template <>
     struct fmt::formatter<S> : fmt::formatter<int> {
       auto format(S, format_context& ctx) {
         return formatter<int>::format(2, ctx);
       }
     };

     int main() {
       std::cout << S() << "\n"; // prints 1 using operator<<
       fmt::print("{}\n", S());  // prints 2 using formatter
     }

* Introduced the experimental ``fmt::compile`` function that does format string
  compilation (`#618 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/618>`_,
  `#1169 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1169>`_,
  `#1171 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1171>`_):

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/compile.h>

     auto f = fmt::compile<int>("{}");
     std::string s = fmt::format(f, 42); // can be called multiple times to
                                         // format different values
     // s == "42"

  It moves the cost of parsing a format string outside of the format function
  which can be beneficial when identically formatting many objects of the same
  types. Thanks `@stryku (Mateusz Janek) <https://github.com/stryku>`_.

* Added experimental ``%`` format specifier that formats floating-point values
  as percentages (`#1060 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1060>`_,
  `#1069 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1069>`_,
  `#1071 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1071>`_):

  .. code:: c++

     auto s = fmt::format("{:.1%}", 0.42); // s == "42.0%"

  Thanks `@gawain-bolton (Gawain Bolton) <https://github.com/gawain-bolton>`_.

* Implemented precision for floating-point durations
  (`#1004 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1004>`_,
  `#1012 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1012>`_):

  .. code:: c++

     auto s = fmt::format("{:.1}", std::chrono::duration<double>(1.234));
     // s == 1.2s

  Thanks `@DanielaE (Daniela Engert) <https://github.com/DanielaE>`_.

* Implemented ``chrono`` format specifiers ``%Q`` and ``%q`` that give the value
  and the unit respectively (`#1019 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1019>`_):

  .. code:: c++

     auto value = fmt::format("{:%Q}", 42s); // value == "42"
     auto unit  = fmt::format("{:%q}", 42s); // unit == "s"

  Thanks `@DanielaE (Daniela Engert) <https://github.com/DanielaE>`_.

* Fixed handling of dynamic width in chrono formatter:

  .. code:: c++

     auto s = fmt::format("{0:{1}%H:%M:%S}", std::chrono::seconds(12345), 12);
     //                        ^ width argument index                     ^ width
     // s == "03:25:45    "

  Thanks Howard Hinnant.

* Removed deprecated ``fmt/time.h``. Use ``fmt/chrono.h`` instead.

* Added ``fmt::format`` and ``fmt::vformat`` overloads that take ``text_style``
  (`#993 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/993>`_,
  `#994 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/994>`_):

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/color.h>

     std::string message = fmt::format(fmt::emphasis::bold | fg(fmt::color::red),
                                       "The answer is {}.", 42);

  Thanks `@Naios (Denis Blank) <https://github.com/Naios>`_.

* Removed the deprecated color API (``print_colored``). Use the new API, namely
  ``print`` overloads that take ``text_style`` instead.

* Made ``std::unique_ptr`` and ``std::shared_ptr`` formattable as pointers via
  ``fmt::ptr`` (`#1121 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1121>`_):

  .. code:: c++

     std::unique_ptr<int> p = ...;
     fmt::print("{}", fmt::ptr(p)); // prints p as a pointer

  Thanks `@sighingnow (Tao He) <https://github.com/sighingnow>`_.

* Made ``print`` and ``vprint`` report I/O errors
  (`#1098 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1098>`_,
  `#1099 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1099>`_).
  Thanks `@BillyDonahue (Billy Donahue) <https://github.com/BillyDonahue>`_.

* Marked deprecated APIs with the ``[[deprecated]]`` attribute and removed
  internal uses of deprecated APIs
  (`#1022 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1022>`_).
  Thanks `@eliaskosunen (Elias Kosunen) <https://github.com/eliaskosunen>`_.

* Modernized the codebase using more C++11 features and removing workarounds.
  Most importantly, ``buffer_context`` is now an alias template, so
  use ``buffer_context<T>`` instead of ``buffer_context<T>::type``.
  These features require GCC 4.8 or later.

* ``formatter`` specializations now always take precedence over implicit
  conversions to ``int`` and the undocumented ``convert_to_int`` trait
  is now deprecated.

* Moved the undocumented ``basic_writer``, ``writer``, and ``wwriter`` types
  to the ``internal`` namespace.

* Removed deprecated ``basic_format_context::begin()``. Use ``out()`` instead.

* Disallowed passing the result of ``join`` as an lvalue to prevent misuse.

* Refactored the undocumented structs that represent parsed format specifiers
  to simplify the API and allow multibyte fill.

* Moved SFINAE to template parameters to reduce symbol sizes.

* Switched to ``fputws`` for writing wide strings so that it's no longer
  required to call ``_setmode`` on Windows
  (`#1229 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1229>`_,
  `#1243 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1243>`_).
  Thanks `@jackoalan (Jack Andersen) <https://github.com/jackoalan>`_.

* Improved literal-based API
  (`#1254 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1254>`_).
  Thanks `@sylveon (Charles Milette) <https://github.com/sylveon>`_.

* Added support for exotic platforms without ``uintptr_t`` such as IBM i
  (AS/400) which has 128-bit pointers and only 64-bit integers
  (`#1059 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1059>`_).

* Added `Sublime Text syntax highlighting config
  <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/blob/master/support/C%2B%2B.sublime-syntax>`_
  (`#1037 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1037>`_).
  Thanks `@Kronuz (GermÃ¡n MÃ©ndez Bravo) <https://github.com/Kronuz>`_.

* Added the ``FMT_ENFORCE_COMPILE_STRING`` macro to enforce the use of
  compile-time format strings
  (`#1231 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1231>`_).
  Thanks `@jackoalan (Jack Andersen) <https://github.com/jackoalan>`_.

* Stopped setting ``CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`` if {fmt} is a subproject
  (`#1081 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1081>`_).

* Various build improvements
  (`#1039 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/1039>`_,

5.3.0 - 2018-12-28
------------------

* Introduced experimental chrono formatting support:

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/chrono.h>

     int main() {
       using namespace std::literals::chrono_literals;
       fmt::print("Default format: {} {}\n", 42s, 100ms);
       fmt::print("strftime-like format: {:%H:%M:%S}\n", 3h + 15min + 30s);
     }

  prints::

     Default format: 42s 100ms
     strftime-like format: 03:15:30

* Added experimental support for emphasis (bold, italic, underline,
  strikethrough), colored output to a file stream, and improved colored
  formatting API
  (`#961 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/961>`_,
  `#967 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/967>`_,
  `#973 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/973>`_):

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/color.h>

     int main() {
       print(fg(fmt::color::crimson) | fmt::emphasis::bold,
             "Hello, {}!\n", "world");
       print(fg(fmt::color::floral_white) | bg(fmt::color::slate_gray) |
             fmt::emphasis::underline, "Hello, {}!\n", "Ð¼Ð¸Ñ");
       print(fg(fmt::color::steel_blue) | fmt::emphasis::italic,
             "Hello, {}!\n", "ä¸ç");
     }

  prints the following on modern terminals with RGB color support:

             50405788-b66e7500-076e-11e9-9592-7324d1f951d8.png

  Thanks `@Rakete1111 (Nicolas) <https://github.com/Rakete1111>`_.

* Added support for 4-bit terminal colors
  (`#968 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/968>`_,
  `#974 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/974>`_)

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/color.h>

     int main() {
       print(fg(fmt::terminal_color::red), "stop\n");
     }

  Note that these colors vary by terminal:

             50405925-dbfc7e00-0770-11e9-9b85-333fab0af9ac.png

  Thanks `@Rakete1111 (Nicolas) <https://github.com/Rakete1111>`_.

* Parameterized formatting functions on the type of the format string
  (`#880 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/880>`_,
  `#881 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/881>`_,
  `#883 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/883>`_,
  `#885 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/885>`_,
  `#897 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/897>`_,
  `#920 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/920>`_).
  Any object of type ``S`` that has an overloaded ``to_string_view(const S&)``
  returning ``fmt::string_view`` can be used as a format string:

  .. code:: c++

     namespace my_ns {
     inline string_view to_string_view(const my_string& s) {
       return {s.data(), s.length()};
     }
     }

     std::string message = fmt::format(my_string("The answer is {}."), 42);

  Thanks `@DanielaE (Daniela Engert) <https://github.com/DanielaE>`_.

* Made ``std::string_view`` work as a format string
  (`#898 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/898>`_):

  .. code:: c++

     auto message = fmt::format(std::string_view("The answer is {}."), 42);

  Thanks `@DanielaE (Daniela Engert) <https://github.com/DanielaE>`_.

* Added wide string support to compile-time format string checks
  (`#924 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/924>`_):

  .. code:: c++

     print(fmt(L"{:f}"), 42); // compile-time error: invalid type specifier

  Thanks `@XZiar <https://github.com/XZiar>`_.

* Made colored print functions work with wide strings
  (`#867 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/867>`_):

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/color.h>

     int main() {
       print(fg(fmt::color::red), L"{}\n", 42);
     }

  Thanks `@DanielaE (Daniela Engert) <https://github.com/DanielaE>`_.

* Introduced experimental Unicode support
  (`#628 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/628>`_,
  `#891 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/891>`_):

  .. code:: c++

     using namespace fmt::literals;
     auto s = fmt::format("{:*^5}"_u, "ð¤¡"_u); // s == "**ð¤¡**"_u

* Improved locale support:

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/locale.h>

     struct numpunct : std::numpunct<char> {
      protected:
       char do_thousands_sep() const override { return '~'; }
     };

     std::locale loc;
     auto s = fmt::format(std::locale(loc, new numpunct()), "{:n}", 1234567);
     // s == "1~234~567"

* Constrained formatting functions on proper iterator types
  (`#921 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/921>`_).
  Thanks `@DanielaE (Daniela Engert) <https://github.com/DanielaE>`_.

* Added ``make_printf_args`` and ``make_wprintf_args`` functions
  (`#934 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/934>`_).
  Thanks `@tnovotny <https://github.com/tnovotny>`_.

* Deprecated ``fmt::visit``, ``parse_context``, and ``wparse_context``.
  Use ``fmt::visit_format_arg``, ``format_parse_context``, and
  ``wformat_parse_context`` instead.

* Removed undocumented ``basic_fixed_buffer`` which has been superseded by the
  iterator-based API
  (`#873 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/873>`_,
  `#902 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/902>`_).
  Thanks `@superfunc (hollywood programmer) <https://github.com/superfunc>`_.

* Disallowed repeated leading zeros in an argument ID:

  .. code:: c++

     fmt::print("{000}", 42); // error

* Reintroduced support for gcc 4.4.

* Fixed compilation on platforms with exotic ``double``
  (`#878 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/878>`_).

  `@DarkDimius (Dmitry Petrashko) <https://github.com/DarkDimius>`_,
  `@HecticSerenity <https://github.com/HecticSerenity>`_.

* Added pkgconfig support which makes it easier to consume the library from
  meson and other build systems
  (`#916 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/916>`_).
  Thanks `@colemickens (Cole Mickens) <https://github.com/colemickens>`_.

5.2.1 - 2018-09-21
------------------

* Fixed ``visit`` lookup issues on gcc 7 & 8
  (`#870 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/870>`_).
  Thanks `@medithe <https://github.com/medithe>`_.

* Fixed linkage errors on older gcc.

* Prevented ``fmt/range.h`` from specializing ``fmt::basic_string_view``
  (`#865 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/865>`_,
  `#868 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/868>`_).
  Thanks `@hhggit (dual) <https://github.com/hhggit>`_.

* Improved error message when formatting unknown types
  (`#872 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/872>`_).
  Thanks `@foonathan (Jonathan MÃ¼ller) <https://github.com/foonathan>`_,

* Disabled templated user-defined literals when compiled under nvcc
  (`#875 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/875>`_).
  Thanks `@CandyGumdrop (Candy Gumdrop) <https://github.com/CandyGumdrop>`_,

* Fixed ``format_to`` formatting to ``wmemory_buffer``
  (`#874 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/874>`_).

5.2.0 - 2018-09-13
------------------

* Optimized format string parsing and argument processing which resulted in up
  to 5x speed up on long format strings and significant performance boost on
  various benchmarks. For example, version 5.2 is 2.22x faster than 5.1 on
  decimal integer formatting with ``format_to`` (macOS, clang-902.0.39.2):

  ==================  =======  =======
  Method              Time, s  Speedup
  ==================  =======  =======
  fmt::format 5.1      0.58
  fmt::format 5.2      0.35     1.66x
  fmt::format_to 5.1   0.51
  fmt::format_to 5.2   0.23     2.22x
  sprintf              0.71
  std::to_string       1.01
  std::stringstream    1.73
  ==================  =======  =======

* Changed the ``fmt`` macro from opt-out to opt-in to prevent name collisions.
  To enable it define the ``FMT_STRING_ALIAS`` macro to 1 before including
  ``fmt/format.h``:

  .. code:: c++

     #define FMT_STRING_ALIAS 1
     #include <fmt/format.h>
     std::string answer = format(fmt("{}"), 42);

* Added compile-time format string checks to ``format_to`` overload that takes
  ``fmt::memory_buffer`` (`#783 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/783>`_):

  .. code:: c++

     fmt::memory_buffer buf;
     // Compile-time error: invalid type specifier.
     fmt::format_to(buf, fmt("{:d}"), "foo");

* Moved experimental color support to ``fmt/color.h`` and enabled the
  new API by default. The old API can be enabled by defining the
  ``FMT_DEPRECATED_COLORS`` macro.

* Added formatting support for types explicitly convertible to
  ``fmt::string_view``:

  .. code:: c++

     struct foo {
       explicit operator fmt::string_view() const { return "foo"; }
     };
     auto s = format("{}", foo());

  In particular, this makes formatting function work with
  ``folly::StringPiece``.

* Implemented preliminary support for ``char*_t`` by replacing the ``format``
  function overloads with a single function template parameterized on the string
  type.

* Added support for dynamic argument lists
  (`#814 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/814>`_,
  `#819 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/819>`_).
  Thanks `@MikePopoloski (Michael Popoloski)
  <https://github.com/MikePopoloski>`_.

* Reduced executable size overhead for embedded targets using newlib nano by
  making locale dependency optional
  (`#839 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/839>`_).
  Thanks `@teajay-fr (Thomas Benard) <https://github.com/teajay-fr>`_.

* Keep ``noexcept`` specifier when exceptions are disabled
  (`#801 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/801>`_,
  `#810 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/810>`_).
  Thanks `@qis (Alexej Harm) <https://github.com/qis>`_.

* Fixed formatting of user-defined types providing ``operator<<`` with
  ``format_to_n``
  (`#806 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/806>`_).
  Thanks `@mkurdej (Marek Kurdej) <https://github.com/mkurdej>`_.

* Fixed dynamic linkage of new symbols
  (`#808 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/808>`_).

* Fixed global initialization issue
  (`#807 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/807>`_):

  .. code:: c++

     // This works on compilers with constexpr support.
     static const std::string answer = fmt::format("{}", 42);

* Fixed various compiler warnings and errors
  (`#804 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/804>`_,
  `#809 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/809>`_,
  `#811 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/811>`_,

  `@eliasdaler (Elias Daler) <https://github.com/eliasdaler>`_.

5.1.0 - 2018-07-05
------------------

* Added experimental support for RGB color output enabled with
  the ``FMT_EXTENDED_COLORS`` macro:

  .. code:: c++

     #define FMT_EXTENDED_COLORS
     #define FMT_HEADER_ONLY // or compile fmt with FMT_EXTENDED_COLORS defined
     #include <fmt/format.h>

     fmt::print(fmt::color::steel_blue, "Some beautiful text");

  The old API (the ``print_colored`` and ``vprint_colored`` functions and the
  ``color`` enum) is now deprecated.
  (`#762 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/762>`_
  `#767 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/767>`_).
  thanks `@Remotion (Remo) <https://github.com/Remotion>`_.

* Added quotes to strings in ranges and tuples
  (`#766 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/766>`_).
  Thanks `@Remotion (Remo) <https://github.com/Remotion>`_.

* Made ``format_to`` work with ``basic_memory_buffer``
  (`#776 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/776>`_).

* Added ``vformat_to_n`` and ``wchar_t`` overload of ``format_to_n``
  (`#764 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/764>`_,
  `#769 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/769>`_).

* Made ``is_range`` and ``is_tuple_like`` part of public (experimental) API
  to allow specialization for user-defined types
  (`#751 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/751>`_,
  `#759 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/759>`_).
  Thanks `@drrlvn (Dror Levin) <https://github.com/drrlvn>`_.

* Added more compilers to continuous integration and increased ``FMT_PEDANTIC``
  warning levels
  (`#736 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/736>`_).
  Thanks `@eliaskosunen (Elias Kosunen) <https://github.com/eliaskosunen>`_.

* Fixed compilation with MSVC 2013.

* Fixed handling of user-defined types in ``format_to``
  (`#793 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/793>`_).

* Forced linking of inline ``vformat`` functions into the library
  (`#795 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/795>`_).

* Fixed incorrect call to on_align in ``'{:}='``
  (`#750 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/750>`_).

* Fixed floating-point formatting to a non-back_insert_iterator with sign &
  numeric alignment specified
  (`#756 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/756>`_).

* Fixed formatting to an array with ``format_to_n``
  (`#778 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/778>`_).

* Fixed formatting of more than 15 named arguments
  (`#754 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/754>`_).

* Fixed handling of compile-time strings when including ``fmt/ostream.h``.
  (`#768 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/768>`_).

* Fixed various compiler warnings and errors
  (`#742 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/742>`_,

5.0.0 - 2018-05-21
------------------

* Added a requirement for partial C++11 support, most importantly variadic
  templates and type traits, and dropped ``FMT_VARIADIC_*`` emulation macros.
  Variadic templates are available since GCC 4.4, Clang 2.9 and MSVC 18.0 (2013).
  For older compilers use {fmt} `version 4.x
  <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/releases/tag/4.1.0>`_ which continues to be
  maintained and works with C++98 compilers.

* Renamed symbols to follow standard C++ naming conventions and proposed a subset
  of the library for standardization in `P0645R2 Text Formatting
  <https://wg21.link/P0645>`_.

* Implemented ``constexpr`` parsing of format strings and `compile-time format
  string checks
  <https://fmt.dev/latest/api.html#compile-time-format-string-checks>`_. For
  example

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/format.h>

     std::string s = format(fmt("{:d}"), "foo");

  gives a compile-time error because ``d`` is an invalid specifier for strings
  (`godbolt <https://godbolt.org/g/rnCy9Q>`__)::

     ...
     <source>:4:19: note: in instantiation of function template specialization 'fmt::v5::format<S, char [4]>' requested here
       std::string s = format(fmt("{:d}"), "foo");
                       ^
     format.h:1337:13: note: non-constexpr function 'on_error' cannot be used in a constant expression
         handler.on_error("invalid type specifier");

  Compile-time checks require relaxed ``constexpr`` (C++14 feature) support. If
  the latter is not available, checks will be performed at runtime.

* Separated format string parsing and formatting in the extension API to enable
  compile-time format string processing. For example

  .. code:: c++

     struct Answer {};

     namespace fmt {
     template <>
     struct formatter<Answer> {
       constexpr auto parse(parse_context& ctx) {
         auto it = ctx.begin();
         spec = *it;
         if (spec != 'd' && spec != 's')
           throw format_error("invalid specifier");
         return ++it;
       }

       template <typename FormatContext>
       auto format(Answer, FormatContext& ctx) {
         return spec == 's' ?
           format_to(ctx.begin(), "{}", "fourty-two") :
           format_to(ctx.begin(), "{}", 42);
       }

       char spec = 0;
     };
     }

     std::string s = format(fmt("{:x}"), Answer());

  gives a compile-time error due to invalid format specifier (`godbolt
  <https://godbolt.org/g/2jQ1Dv>`__)::

     ...
     <source>:12:45: error: expression '<throw-expression>' is not a constant expression
            throw format_error("invalid specifier");

* Added `iterator support
  <https://fmt.dev/latest/api.html#output-iterator-support>`_:

  .. code:: c++

     #include <vector>
     #include <fmt/format.h>

     std::vector<char> out;
     fmt::format_to(std::back_inserter(out), "{}", 42);

* Added the `format_to_n
  <https://fmt.dev/latest/api.html#_CPPv2N3fmt11format_to_nE8OutputItNSt6size_tE11string_viewDpRK4Args>`_
  function that restricts the output to the specified number of characters
  (`#298 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/298>`_):

  .. code:: c++

     char out[4];
     fmt::format_to_n(out, sizeof(out), "{}", 12345);
     // out == "1234" (without terminating '\0')

* Added the `formatted_size
  <https://fmt.dev/latest/api.html#_CPPv2N3fmt14formatted_sizeE11string_viewDpRK4Args>`_
  function for computing the output size:

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/format.h>

     auto size = fmt::formatted_size("{}", 12345); // size == 5

* Improved compile times by reducing dependencies on standard headers and
  providing a lightweight `core API <https://fmt.dev/latest/api.html#core-api>`_:

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/core.h>

     fmt::print("The answer is {}.", 42);

  See `Compile time and code bloat
  <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt#compile-time-and-code-bloat>`_.

* Added the `make_format_args
  <https://fmt.dev/latest/api.html#_CPPv2N3fmt16make_format_argsEDpRK4Args>`_
  function for capturing formatting arguments:

  .. code:: c++
  
     // Prints formatted error message.
     void vreport_error(const char *format, fmt::format_args args) {
       fmt::print("Error: ");
       fmt::vprint(format, args);
     }
     template <typename... Args>
     void report_error(const char *format, const Args & ... args) {
       vreport_error(format, fmt::make_format_args(args...));
     }

  (`#687 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/687>`_,
  `#694 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/694>`_).
  Thanks `@Kronuz (GermÃ¡n MÃ©ndez Bravo) <https://github.com/Kronuz>`_.

* Added prefix ``v`` to non-variadic functions taking ``format_args`` to
  distinguish them from variadic ones:

  .. code:: c++

     std::string vformat(string_view format_str, format_args args);
     
     template <typename... Args>
     std::string format(string_view format_str, const Args & ... args);

* Added experimental support for formatting ranges, containers and tuple-like
  types in ``fmt/ranges.h`` (`#735 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/735>`_):

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/ranges.h>

     std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3};
     fmt::print("{}", v); // prints {1, 2, 3}

  Thanks `@Remotion (Remo) <https://github.com/Remotion>`_.

* Implemented ``wchar_t`` date and time formatting
  (`#712 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/712>`_):

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/time.h>

* Provided more wide string overloads
  (`#724 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/724>`_).
  Thanks `@DanielaE (Daniela Engert) <https://github.com/DanielaE>`_.

* Switched from a custom null-terminated string view class to ``string_view``
  in the format API and provided ``fmt::string_view`` which implements a subset
  of ``std::string_view`` API for pre-C++17 systems.

* Added support for ``std::experimental::string_view``
  (`#607 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/607>`_):

  .. code:: c++

     #include <fmt/core.h>
     #include <experimental/string_view>

     fmt::print("{}", std::experimental::string_view("foo"));

  Thanks `@virgiliofornazin (Virgilio Alexandre Fornazin)

  <https://github.com/smellman>`_.

3.0.0 - 2016-05-07
------------------

* The project has been renamed from C++ Format (cppformat) to fmt for
  consistency with the used namespace and macro prefix
  (`#307 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/307>`_).
  Library headers are now located in the ``fmt`` directory:

  .. code:: c++

    #include "fmt/format.h"

  Including ``format.h`` from the ``cppformat`` directory is deprecated
  but works via a proxy header which will be removed in the next major version.
  
  The documentation is now available at https://fmt.dev.

* Added support for `strftime <http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/chrono/c/strftime>`_-like
  `date and time formatting <https://fmt.dev/3.0.0/api.html#date-and-time-formatting>`_
  (`#283 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/283>`_):

  .. code:: c++

    #include "fmt/time.h"

    std::time_t t = std::time(nullptr);
    // Prints "The date is 2016-04-29." (with the current date)
    fmt::print("The date is {:%Y-%m-%d}.", *std::localtime(&t));

* ``std::ostream`` support including formatting of user-defined types that provide
  overloaded ``operator<<`` has been moved to ``fmt/ostream.h``:

  .. code:: c++

    #include "fmt/ostream.h"

    class Date {
      int year_, month_, day_;
    public:
      Date(int year, int month, int day) : year_(year), month_(month), day_(day) {}

      friend std::ostream &operator<<(std::ostream &os, const Date &d) {
        return os << d.year_ << '-' << d.month_ << '-' << d.day_;
      }
    };

    std::string s = fmt::format("The date is {}", Date(2012, 12, 9));
    // s == "The date is 2012-12-9"

* Added support for `custom argument formatters
  <https://fmt.dev/3.0.0/api.html#argument-formatters>`_
  (`#235 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/235>`_).

* Added support for locale-specific integer formatting with the ``n`` specifier
  (`#305 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/305>`_):

  .. code:: c++

    std::setlocale(LC_ALL, "en_US.utf8");
    fmt::print("cppformat: {:n}\n", 1234567); // prints 1,234,567

* Sign is now preserved when formatting an integer with an incorrect ``printf``
  format specifier (`#265 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/265>`_):

  .. code:: c++

    fmt::printf("%lld", -42); // prints -42

  Note that it would be an undefined behavior in ``std::printf``.

* Length modifiers such as ``ll`` are now optional in printf formatting
  functions and the correct type is determined automatically
  (`#255 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/255>`_):

  .. code:: c++

    fmt::printf("%d", std::numeric_limits<long long>::max());

  Note that it would be an undefined behavior in ``std::printf``.

* Added initial support for custom formatters
  (`#231 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/231>`_).

* Fixed detection of user-defined literal support on Intel C++ compiler
  (`#311 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/311>`_,
  `#312 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/312>`_).
  Thanks to `@dean0x7d (Dean Moldovan) <https://github.com/dean0x7d>`_ and
  `@speth (Ray Speth) <https://github.com/speth>`_.

  `#173 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/173>`_,
  `#174 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/174>`_):

  .. code:: c++

    fmt::print("The answer is {answer}.", fmt::arg("answer", 42));

  Thanks to `@jamboree <https://github.com/jamboree>`_.

* [Experimental] User-defined literals for format and named arguments
  (`#204 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/204>`_,

  Thanks to `@dean0x7d (Dean Moldovan) <https://github.com/dean0x7d>`_.

* [Breaking] Formatting of more than 16 arguments is now supported when using
  variadic templates
  (`#141 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/141>`_).
  Thanks to `@Shauren <https://github.com/Shauren>`_.

* Runtime width specification
  (`#168 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/168>`_):

  .. code:: c++

    fmt::format("{0:{1}}", 42, 5); // gives "   42"

  Thanks to `@jamboree <https://github.com/jamboree>`_.

  operator (``operator<<``) if available
  (`#232 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/232>`_).

* [Breaking] Changed default ``bool`` format to textual, "true" or "false"
  (`#170 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/170>`_):

  .. code:: c++
  
    fmt::print("{}", true); // prints "true"

  To print ``bool`` as a number use numeric format specifier such as ``d``:

  .. code:: c++

  Thanks to `@LarsGullik <https://github.com/LarsGullik>`_.

* [Breaking] ``fmt::printf`` and ``fmt::sprintf`` now print null pointers as ``(nil)``
  and null strings as ``(null)`` for consistency with glibc
  (`#226 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/226>`_).
  Thanks to `@LarsGullik <https://github.com/LarsGullik>`_.

* [Breaking] ``fmt::(s)printf`` now supports formatting of objects of user-defined types
  that provide an overloaded ``std::ostream`` insertion operator (``operator<<``)
  (`#201 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/201>`_):

  .. code:: c++

    fmt::printf("The date is %s", Date(2012, 12, 9));

* [Breaking] The ``Buffer`` template is now part of the public API and can be used
  to implement custom memory buffers
  (`#140 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/140>`_).
  Thanks to `@polyvertex (Jean-Charles Lefebvre) <https://github.com/polyvertex>`_.

  `#159 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/159>`_,
  `#183 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/183>`_):

  - Comparison operators now compare string content, not pointers
  - ``BasicStringRef::c_str`` replaced by ``BasicStringRef::data``
  - ``BasicStringRef`` is no longer assumed to be null-terminated

  References to null-terminated strings are now represented by a new class,
  ``BasicCStringRef``.

* Dependency on pthreads introduced by Google Test is now optional
  (`#185 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/185>`_).

* New CMake options ``FMT_DOC``, ``FMT_INSTALL`` and ``FMT_TEST`` to control
  generation of ``doc``, ``install`` and ``test`` targets respectively, on by default
  (`#197 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/197>`_,
  `#198 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/198>`_,

  Thanks to `@alfps (Alf P. Steinbach) <https://github.com/alfps>`_.

* [Breaking] ``windows.h`` is now included with ``NOMINMAX`` unless
  ``FMT_WIN_MINMAX`` is defined. This is done to prevent breaking code using
  ``std::min`` and ``std::max`` and only affects the header-only configuration
  (`#152 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/152>`_,
  `#153 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/153>`_,
  `#154 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/154>`_).

  `#116 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/116>`_,
  `#118 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/118>`_ and
  `#121 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/121>`_).
  Previously these optimizations where only used on GCC and Clang.

* Added `changelog <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/blob/master/ChangeLog.rst>`_
  (`#103 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/103>`_).

1.0.0 - 2015-02-05
------------------

* Add support for a header-only configuration when ``FMT_HEADER_ONLY`` is
  defined before including ``format.h``:

  .. code:: c++

    #define FMT_HEADER_ONLY
    #include "format.h"

* Compute string length in the constructor of ``BasicStringRef``
  instead of the ``size`` method
  (`#79 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/79>`_).
  This eliminates size computation for string literals on reasonable optimizing
  compilers.

* Fix formatting of types with overloaded ``operator <<`` for ``std::wostream``
  (`#86 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/86>`_):

  .. code:: c++

    fmt::format(L"The date is {0}", Date(2012, 12, 9));

* Fix linkage of tests on Arch Linux
  (`#89 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/89>`_).

* Allow precision specifier for non-float arguments
  (`#90 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/90>`_):

  .. code:: c++

    fmt::print("{:.3}\n", "Carpet"); // prints "Car"

* Fix build on Android NDK
  (`#93 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/93>`_)

* Improvements to documentation build procedure.

* Remove ``FMT_SHARED`` CMake variable in favor of standard `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS
  <http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/variable/BUILD_SHARED_LIBS.html>`_.

* Fix error handling in ``fmt::fprintf``.

* Fix a number of warnings.

0.12.0 - 2014-10-25
-------------------

* [Breaking] Improved separation between formatting and buffer management.
  ``Writer`` is now a base class that cannot be instantiated directly.
  The new ``MemoryWriter`` class implements the default buffer management
  with small allocations done on stack. So ``fmt::Writer`` should be replaced
  with ``fmt::MemoryWriter`` in variable declarations.

  Old code:

  .. code:: c++

    fmt::Writer w;

  New code: 

  .. code:: c++

    fmt::MemoryWriter w;

  If you pass ``fmt::Writer`` by reference, you can continue to do so:

  .. code:: c++

      void f(fmt::Writer &w);

  This doesn't affect the formatting API.

* Support for custom memory allocators
  (`#69 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/69>`_)

* Formatting functions now accept `signed char` and `unsigned char` strings as
  arguments (`#73 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/73>`_):

  .. code:: c++

    auto s = format("GLSL version: {}", glGetString(GL_VERSION));

* Reduced code bloat. According to the new `benchmark results
  <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt#compile-time-and-code-bloat>`_,
  cppformat is close to ``printf`` and by the order of magnitude better than
  Boost Format in terms of compiled code size.

* Improved appearance of the documentation on mobile by using the `Sphinx
  Bootstrap theme <http://ryan-roemer.github.io/sphinx-bootstrap-theme/>`_:

0.11.0 - 2014-08-21
-------------------

* Safe printf implementation with a POSIX extension for positional arguments:

  .. code:: c++

    fmt::printf("Elapsed time: %.2f seconds", 1.23);
    fmt::printf("%1$s, %3$d %2$s", weekday, month, day);

* Arguments of ``char`` type can now be formatted as integers
  (Issue `#55 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/55>`_):

  .. code:: c++

    fmt::format("0x{0:02X}", 'a');

* Deprecated parts of the API removed.

* The library is now built and tested on MinGW with Appveyor in addition to
  existing test platforms Linux/GCC, OS X/Clang, Windows/MSVC.

0.10.0 - 2014-07-01
-------------------

**Improved API**

* All formatting methods are now implemented as variadic functions instead
  of using ``operator<<`` for feeding arbitrary arguments into a temporary
  formatter object. This works both with C++11 where variadic templates are
  used and with older standards where variadic functions are emulated by
  providing lightweight wrapper functions defined with the ``FMT_VARIADIC``
  macro. You can use this macro for defining your own portable variadic
  functions:

  .. code:: c++

    void report_error(const char *format, const fmt::ArgList &args) {
      fmt::print("Error: {}");
      fmt::print(format, args);
    }
    FMT_VARIADIC(void, report_error, const char *)

    report_error("file not found: {}", path);

  Apart from a more natural syntax, this also improves performance as there
  is no need to construct temporary formatter objects and control arguments'
  lifetimes. Because the wrapper functions are very lightweight, this doesn't
  cause code bloat even in pre-C++11 mode.

* Simplified common case of formatting an ``std::string``. Now it requires a
  single function call:

  .. code:: c++

    std::string s = format("The answer is {}.", 42);

  Previously it required 2 function calls:

  .. code:: c++

    std::string s = str(Format("The answer is {}.") << 42);

  Instead of unsafe ``c_str`` function, ``fmt::Writer`` should be used directly
  to bypass creation of ``std::string``:

  .. code:: c++

    fmt::Writer w;
    w.write("The answer is {}.", 42);
    w.c_str();  // returns a C string

  This doesn't do dynamic memory allocation for small strings and is less error
  prone as the lifetime of the string is the same as for ``std::string::c_str``
  which is well understood (hopefully).

* Improved consistency in naming functions that are a part of the public API.
  Now all public functions are lowercase following the standard library
  conventions. Previously it was a combination of lowercase and
  CapitalizedWords.
  Issue `#50 <https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/50>`_.

* Old functions are marked as deprecated and will be removed in the next
  release.

**Other Changes**

* Experimental support for printf format specifications (work in progress):

  .. code:: c++

    fmt::printf("The answer is %d.", 42);
    std::string s = fmt::sprintf("Look, a %s!", "string");

* Support for hexadecimal floating point format specifiers ``a`` and ``A``:

  .. code:: c++

    print("{:a}", -42.0); // Prints -0x1.5p+5
    print("{:A}", -42.0); // Prints -0X1.5P+5

* CMake option ``FMT_SHARED`` that specifies whether to build format as a
  shared library (off by default).

0.9.0 - 2014-05-13
------------------

* More efficient implementation of variadic formatting functions.

* ``Writer::Format`` now has a variadic overload:

  .. code:: c++

    Writer out;
    out.Format("Look, I'm {}!", "variadic");

* For efficiency and consistency with other overloads, variadic overload of
  the ``Format`` function now returns ``Writer`` instead of ``std::string``.
  Use the ``str`` function to convert it to ``std::string``:

  .. code:: c++

    std::string s = str(Format("Look, I'm {}!", "variadic"));

* Replaced formatter actions with output sinks: ``NoAction`` -> ``NullSink``,
  ``Write`` -> ``FileSink``, ``ColorWriter`` -> ``ANSITerminalSink``.
  This improves naming consistency and shouldn't affect client code unless
  these classes are used directly which should be rarely needed.

* Added ``ThrowSystemError`` function that formats a message and throws
  ``SystemError`` containing the formatted message and system-specific error
  description. For example, the following code

  .. code:: c++

    FILE *f = fopen(filename, "r");
    if (!f)
      ThrowSystemError(errno, "Failed to open file '{}'") << filename;

  will throw ``SystemError`` exception with description
  "Failed to open file '<filename>': No such file or directory" if file
  doesn't exist.

* Support for AppVeyor continuous integration platform.

* ``Format`` now throws ``SystemError`` in case of I/O errors.

* Improve test infrastructure. Print functions are now tested by redirecting
  the output to a pipe.

0.8.0 - 2014-04-14
------------------

* Initial release
